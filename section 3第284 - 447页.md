## Introduction  

Already Hippocrates in his descriptions of the ‘Sacred Disease’ discussed several types of epileptic seizures. The majority of the descriptions of epilepsy since Hippocrates also includes detailed classifications of the epileptic seizures.1 In most of these cases the seizures are simply classified by their main ictal symptomatology. Until relatively recently, however, no clear attempts were made to differentiate between epileptic seizures and epilepsies, i.e., the epilepsies were similarly subdivided according to the ictal symptomatology the patient was suffering from. The 1969-proposals by Gastaut2,3 was the first attempt to clearly differentiate between the classification of seizures and the classification of epilepsies. The initial proposals by Gastaut in $1969^{2,3}$ and the international classifications which essentially were modeled following Gastaut’s philosophy were all adhering to the following principles:  

a. Epileptic seizures are paroxysmal events defined by the ictal symptomatology and by a characteristic interictal and ictal EEG.   
b. Epilepsies, on the other hand, are defined by a cluster of signs and symptoms (syndromes) which usually include one or more types of epileptic seizures, associated neurological deficits, a certain age of seizure onset, and a typical prognosis regarding frequency of seizure recurrence and persistence of seizures with age.  

In most cases, however, the seizure type (seizure semiology and EEG) was the main factor which characterized a certain ‘epilepsy syndrome’. Therefore, the distinction between epileptic seizures and epilepsy syndrome was frequently unclear. In most cases also, there was a one-to-one mapping from seizure type to epilepsy syndrome. Typical examples are absence seizures and absence epilepsy or infantile spasms and ‘West syndrome’. Besides, over the years researchers described a progressively larger number of epilepsy syndromes which they felt tended to occur in clusters. This culminated with the recent ‘diagnostic scheme’ for the classification of epileptic seizures and epilepsies,4 which again includes so many different syndromes that even neurologists subspecialized in epilepsy would have difficulties in applying it in everyday practice. This is also most probably the reason this ‘diagnostic scheme,’ even if approved by the ILAE, has never been implemented.  

It is clear that the international classifications of epileptic seizures or epileptic syndromes played a major role in the development of clinical epileptology and have been extremely useful in everyday clinical practice. However, recent diagnostic advances in the epilepsies (including particularly neuroimaging and genetics) point to the need of a completely different approach regarding classification of the ‘epilepsies.’ Epileptic seizures can now be understood as a neurological symptom that occurs in association with an infinite type of insults to the human cortex. We now also know that all epileptic seizures are produced by multiple etiologies which converge in producing a particular type of epileptic seizures.5 In this sense, epilepsy as a symptom is not too different to for example spasticity. Both can be produced by multiple lesions in different parts of the nervous system, both can be the consequence of multiple etiologies, and both respond to medications that are somewhat independent from the location of the lesion or the etiology of the symptom.  

These observations lead us to propose a 5-tier ‘classification’ system.6 Two of these five tiers (semiological characteristics of the seizures and seizure frequency) define the symptom, namely the epileptic seizures. The other three tiers (etiology, associated neurologic deficits, location of the epilepsy) define what is producing the epilepsy and the location of the brain abnormality.  

It is also very important to clarify the terminology as it applies to epileptic seizures and epilepsies. As will become clear below, in the classification system proposed here, epileptic seizures are defined exclusively by ictal semiological features. Therefore, all the modifiers of the term ‘seizures’ refer to ictal semiology and anatomical modifiers (left, right, etc.) refer to the location of these semiological characteristics. For example, in the expression ‘left hand clonic seizures’, left refers to location where the clonus occurs. On the other hand, anatomical modifiers of the expression ‘epilepsy’ refer to the location of the epileptogenic zone, i.e. generalized epilepsy implies that the whole brain is epileptogenic, whereas left paracentral epilepsy implies that the epilepsy originates from the left paracentral region of the brain.  

We will now give a short summary of the five-tier classification system. Detailed description of this system can be found elsewhere.5–16  

### Tier 1: Epilepsy  

This tier defines the location of the epileptogenic zone. The precision with which we can define the location of the epileptogenic zone varies depending on the number and type of diagnostic procedures we perform (interictal EEG, ictal EEG, MRI, PET, SPECT, invasive EEG studies, etc.). The following subdivisions can be defined:  

1. Focal: epileptogenic zone located within one cortical lobe  

a. Frontal   
b. Perirolandic   
c. Temporal i. Neocortical temporal ii. Mesial temporal   
d. Parietal   
e. Occipital   
f. Other   
2. Multilobar: epileptogenic zone affects more than one brain lobe a. Bilobar homotopic: epileptogenic zone affects two homotopic brain lobes (bitemporal, bifrontal, etc.) b. Other   
3. Generalized: epileptogenic zone is bilateral, diffusely distributed affecting most or all of the brain cortex.  

Classical ‘epilepsy syndromes’, which are a shortcut for a constellation of clinical features, almost invariably refer to generalized epilepsies. Most, if not all epilepsy syndromes, are clearly defined by listing the characteristics of the five tiers that are outlined her. However, for many experienced epileptologist the ‘syndromic expression’ is a useful shortcut expression. Therefore, we felt it would be useful to list the epilepsy syndrome in parenthesis after specifying the epileptogenic zone. For example; Epilepsy: Generalized (Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome)  

### Tier 2: Semiological seizure classification  

The ictal semiology is, by definition, the clinical expression of a patient with epilepsy. Until the discovery of the EEG in 1930, epileptic seizures were defined exclusively by clinical semiology.17 However, with the discovery that the EEG could localize the origin of the seizures investigators felt that the combination of the EEG findings and the seizure semiology could add significant precision to an ‘epilepsy classification’. This was the first step towards an ‘epilepsy syndrome’ classification. Later, additional factors like MRI findings, associated neurological deficits, etiology, etc. were added leading to our modern definition of epileptic syndromes. At the same time, as mentioned above, in many instances in which the epilepsy syndrome was defined almost exclusively by the semiology/EEG findings, there was no distinction between semiology/EEG ‘syndrome’ and ‘epilepsy syndrome’.  

In the five-tier epilepsy classification shown here, the second tier classifies the epileptic seizures exclusively by clincial semiology, independent of the results of any other tests (interictal EEG, ictal EEG, MRI, PET, SPECT, neurological and neuropsychological examination, etc.). This leads to a clear distinction between epileptic seizures (refers to the ictal semiology) and epilepsy (refers to the epileptogenic zone). The tests used to define the epileptic seizures is exclusively clinical observation by the physician (video recordings) or by the patient itself or other direct observers (anamnesis). On the other hand, to define the location of the epileptogenic zone (epilepsy) we use the results of all available tests.  

Details of the semiological seizure classification can be found in previous publications.8,10,11,13,15,18–21 The main categories included in the semiological seizure classification are listed below.  

### Semiological seizure classification  

1. Auras a. Somatosensory auras b. Visual auras c. Auditory auras d. Gustatory auras e. Olfactory auras f. Autonomic auras g. Abdominal auras h. Psychic auras   
2. Autonomic Seizures   
3. Dialeptic Seizures   
4. Motor Seizures a. Simple Motor Seizures i. Myoclonic seizures ii. Clonic Seizures iii. Tonic Seizures iv. Versive Seizures v. Tonic-Clonic Seizures vi. Epiletic Spasms b. Complex Motor Seizures i. Automotor seizures ii. Hypermotor seizures iii. Gelastic Seizures   
5. Special Seizures a. Atonic seizures b. Akinetic seizures c. Astatic seizures d. Negative myoclonic seizures e. Hypomotor seizures f. Aphasic seizures  

Each seizure type listed above is considered a seizure component. Each seizure component can be modified by somatotopic modifiers, for example, generalized tonic-clonic seizures or left visual auras. In this case the somatotopic modifier always refers to the clinic semiology. The evolution of a seizure is expressed by linking two to four seizure components by arrows. Alterations of consciousness during a seizure is indicating by inserting (AOC) after the seizure component during which the patient had a clear alteration of consciousness. Besides, lateralizing signs not specified by listing the seizure evolution can be added. Example: Left visual aura $\rightarrow$ left hand clonic seizure $(A O C)\rightarrow$ generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Lateralizing sign: postictal aphasia.  

### Tier 3: Etiology  

It is becoming more and more clear now that epilepsies are always produced by multiple etiologies. In some cases one of the etiological factors might play a clearly dominant role (for example, seizures secondary to a tumor) whereas in other instances it is almost impossible to isolate a single etiology that is responsible for the epileptic seizures (for example, patients with ‘genetic’ epilepsy in which multiple genes contribute to the generation of epileptic seizures). However, there are always multiple contributing etiologies even if there is a single clearly dominant etiological factor. For example, the studies of Andermann and Metrakos5,22,23 show that the incidence of seizures, epilepsy, and EEG abnormalities is significantly higher in close relatives of patients with surgically treated epilepsy than in the general population. This indicates that even in patients who were treated surgically for epilepsy, genetic factors still play a significant role in the etiology of focal, symptomatic epilepsy.  

To facilitate entering the seizure/epilepsy classification into a database, Lodeenkemper et al. suggested the following classification of seizure/epilepsy etiologies.6  

1. Hippocampal sclerosis   
2. Tumor a. Glioma b. Dysembrioplastic neuroepithelial tumor c. Ganglioglioma d. Other  

3. Malformations of cortical development (MCD)  

a. Focal MCD   
b. Hemimegalencephaly   
c. MCD with epidermal nevi   
d. Heterotopic grey matter   
e. Hypothalamic hamartoma   
f. Hypomelanosis of Ito   
g. Other  

4. Malformations of vascular development a. Cavernous angioma b. Arteriovenous malformation c. Sturge–Weber syndrome d. Other  

5. Central nervous system infections  

a. Meningitis b. Encephalitis c. Abscess d. Other  

6. Central nervous system inflammation  

a. Rasmussen encephalitis   
b. Vasculitis   
c. Other  

7. Hypoxic-isquemic brain injury a. Focal ischemic infarction b. Diffuse hypoxic-ischemic injury c. Periventricular leukomalacia d. Hemorrhagic infarction e. Venous sinus thrombosis f. Other  

8. Head trauma  

a. Head trauma with intracranial hemorrhage   
b. Penetrating head injury   
c. Closed head injury   
d. Other  

9. Inheritable conditions a. Presumed genetic cause  

b. Tuberous sclerosis c. Progressive myoclonic epilepsy d. Metabolic syndrome e. Channelopathy f. Mitochondrial disorder g. Chromosomal aberration h. Other 10. Structural brain abnormality of unknown cause 11. Other 12. Unknown etiology  

### Tier 4: Seizure frequency  

The management of a patient with epilepsy is primarily focused on reducing the frequency and intensity of epileptic seizures. Therefore, at each office visit the healthcare provider needs precise information about the type of seizures the patient is actually suffering from (given by the semiological seizure classification) and the number of seizures the patient had since the last visit (given by seizure frequency). In the seizure classification we can just list the average seizure frequency since the last visit or use broad categories which we also defined in previous publications.6  

1. Daily seizures One or more seizures per day   
2. Persistent seizures Less than one seizure per day but at least one seizure/6 months   
3. Rare or no seizures Fewer than one seizure every 6 months   
4. Undefined Seizure frequency can not be specified because of unknown seizure frequency, recent onset of epilepsy or recent surgery of epilepsy  

### Tier 5: Related medical conditions  

Here we provide additional information (free text) about major non-etiological medical conditions the patient may be suffering from. Example: mental retardation, hemianopia, depression, previous surgical procedures, etc.

# 33 Mesial temporal sclerosis  

Already in the late nineteenth century, investigators realized that in patients with epilepsy, mesial temporal sclerosis was frequently found.1 However, it was the development of modern neurodiagnostic techniques and the growing interest in surgery of epilepsy (particularly for patients suffering from mesial temporal sclerosis) that has greatly advanced our understanding of mesial temporal sclerosis. In spite of all these advances, there still are many unanswered questions.  

Mesial temporal sclerosis is defined by its anatomical characteristics, namely gliosis and loss of neurons in the hippocampus, subiculum, parahippocampal gyrus, and inferomedial temporal cortex. Consistently the main change is seen in CA1, CA3, and hilus with relative sparing of CA2 and the granular cells of the dentate gyrus.2 These changes are associated with typical sprouting of the dentate granular cells,3 as well as of neuropeptide Y, substance P, and somastatin fibers.4 Many authors consider these cellular reorganizations as an indispensable feature in the neuropathological diagnosis of mesial temporal sclerosis.  

From an epileptological point of view, mesial temporal sclerosis is of special interest because of its high prevalence and its association with a relatively uniform clinical syndrome of high epileptogenicity. The high epileptogenicity of mesial temporal sclerosis is most probably related to the relatively selective loss of mossy cells in the hilus, essential for an inhibitory feedback to the main hippocampal input pathway, namely the dentate gyrus granular cells,5 and the sprouting of the granular cells, which essentially establishes an excitatory feedback to the dentate gyrus granular cells.3 Direct neurophysiological studies of resected tissue have actually confirmed the hyperexcitability of the granule cells as also the loss of inhibition.6  

The characteristic clinical syndrome is mainly an expression of the fact that mesial temporal sclerosis is a highly epileptogenic lesion that affects selectively a constant region of the brain, namely the hippocampus and the immediately adjacent cortex. There certainly are other focal epilepsies also characterized by a constant pathological substrate (cortical dysplasias, heterotopias, etc.), but none of the other entities affects consistently the same anatomical region. Most of the characteristics of focal (regional) epileptic syndromes, namely semiology of the seizures and interictal and ictal EEG abnormalities, are defined by the location of the epileptogenic zone.  

The abdominal aura, one of the most characteristic initial clinical semiology of seizures arising from the hippocampus, is most probably determined by spreading of the epileptogenic discharge to the closely adjacent insular cortex. In other words, as for most focal epileptogenic lesions, the epileptogenic zone and the symptomatogenic zone does not overlap. Depth recordings have shown that in patients with mesial temporal sclerosis, most of the seizures arise from the hippocampus. However, electrical stimulation suggests that the symptomatogenic area, for most of the symptoms associated with mesial temporal lobe seizures, was due to spread of the epileptiform activity to adjacent structures. Fear, the other typical aura, is most probably produced by activation of the amygdala. Other of the typical auras observed in patients with mesial temporal sclerosis are also most probably an expression of epileptogenic activation of paramesio-temporal regions (basal temporal region for psychic auras, amygdala for olfactory auras, etc). Most of the ictal as well as postictal symptoms observed in patients with mesial temporal sclerosis can also be attributed to a typical spreading pattern of seizures arising from the mesial temporal region (automatisms possibly produced by activation of the cingulate gyrus, postictal aphasia due to ‘Todd paralysis’ of the basal temporal and/or Wernicke’s area, etc.). Certainly all the lateralizing signs seen with seizures arising from the mesial temporal region are also an expression of seizure spread with involvement of adjacent brain regions (basal ganglia for the contralateral dystonia, language areas for the postictal aphasia, ipsilateral motor strip for the contralateral version and clonic seizures, etc.).  

Patients with mesial temporal sclerosis also have a typical interictal and ictal EEG, which again is just an expression of the constant localization of the epileptogenic zone to the mesial temporal region. Surface recordings show spikes and sharp waves localized primarily to sphenoidal and nasopharyngeal electrodes or in the anterior temporal–inferior frontal region (F7-F8). These surface spikes are most probably an expression of epileptiform activity in the parahippocampal cortex as opposed to hippocampal spikes itself. Spikes limited to the hippocampus, which is a closed field, are usually ‘invisible’ to surface electrodes. With depth electrodes, however, the main spiking is detected in the hippocampi. Ictal EEGs, when recorded with surface electrodes, tend to lateralize the seizure onset but only infrequently show localized seizure onset to the anterior temporal–inferior frontal electrodes (Sp1, Sp2, F7, F8). This is an expression of the surface electrodes’ inability to detect hippocampal spikes and the relatively rapid spread of the ictal discharge once a seizure has been initiated. On the other hand, depth electrodes and electrodes placed directly on the hippocampal gyrus (foramen ovale and subdural electrodes) usually demonstrate extremely localized seizure onsets at a time when no alterations are evident when recording simultaneously with surface electrodes.  

There are, in addition, functional alterations typical of patients with mesial temporal sclerosis that are also due to the typical location and neuropathological characteristics of the lesion in these patients, namely a relatively selective loss of neurons usually affecting, to different degrees, both hippocampi. Neuropsychological testing of patients with mesial temporal sclerosis (including particularly pre- and posttemporal lobectomy studies) has greatly contributed to our understanding of the function of the hippocampus. The results of these studies have been complemented by the Wada test and also correlation studies between neuropsychological tests and MRI or neuropathological findings. The results of all these studies show that the dominant (usually left) hippocampus is essential for anterograde verbal memory, whereas the right hippocampus is most probably related to anterograde nonverbal memory. These conclusions come from studies that observed verbal memory deficits in patients with left mesial temporal sclerosis and the degree of deficit was a function of the degree of hippocampal volume loss on MRI studies7–9 or neuronal loss on pathological studies.8,10 This also explains why the postsurgical deficit is most marked in those patients that had the least hippocampal atrophy presurgically, namely patients with (1) intact memory function presurgically11–15; (2) relatively limited atrophy of the hippocampus on MRI16–18; (3) limited histopathological neuronal loss,19–22 and (4) relatively preserved memory of the temporal lobe to be resected on Wada test.23, 24 All these studies also showed that one hippocampus can compensate for most of the functions of the contralateral hippocampus. This is the reason that resection of one hippocampus, if the other hippocampus is relatively intact, leads only to mild to moderate memory deficits. On the other hand, it is well known that bilateral lesions of the hippocampus (e.g., herpes encephalitis) consistently produces devastating anterograde memory deficits.25–27  

It is clear from this discussion that mesial temporal sclerosis is a focal epileptic syndrome that presents an unusually stereotyped clinical picture because the underlying pathology is extremely constant and it consistently affects the same neurological substrate (hippocampus and immediately adjacent cortex). However, it is unlikely that mesial temporal sclerosis is the consequence of a single etiology, the indispensable criterion to classify it as a disease. There is extensive evidence in the literature that the hippocampi are easily damaged by a variety of noxious stimuli. Patients with mesial temporal tumors or hamartomas usually have a mild degree of mesial temporal neuronal loss attributed to the excitotoxic effect of hippocampal seizures. This conclusion is supported by evidence that generalized, or focal status, in adults may induce swelling and eventually may lead to mesial temporal sclerosis.28,29 It has also been shown that patients with mesial temporal sclerosis (shown on pathological studies or by MRI) have a significant higher incidence of febrile convulsions $^{30-34}$ and that mesial temporal sclerosis occurs more frequently in patients who had suffered febrile convulsions.35,36 This evidence again suggests that the febrile convulsions itself could have led to damage of the hippocampus, perhaps by a mechanism of excitotoxicity. However, we should not forget that mesial temporal sclerosis occurs in a high percentage of patients (close to $70\%$ ) with no evidence of febrile convulsions. This again suggests that mesial temporal sclerosis is just the ‘final pathological pathway’ to a number of different hippocampal insults.  

The hypothesis that mesial temporal sclerosis is not a unique disease with a single etiological factor is further supported by the observation that meningitis can frequently lead to mesial temporal sclerosis in children. These studies also suggest that the hippocampus is particularly susceptible to the excitotoxic effects of seizures in children of less than 5 years of age,37–39 corresponding with, a period during which the hippocampus grows rapidly and, there-fore, may be particularly vulnerable. This special susceptibility of the immature brain to damage has also been proven experimentally by Wasterlain and $\mathrm{Plum^{40}}$ and Hattori and Wasterlain.41  

Summarizing, focal epileptic syndromes are currently classified according to the location of the epileptogenic zone. However, patients with an epileptogenic zone in a similar brain structure frequently present with very dissimilar epileptic syndromes because many etiologies can produce epileptogenic zones in a similar or identical brain region. Mesial temporal sclerosis, however, not only affects a clearly defined set of neurons but is associated with an extremely uniform pathological picture. Growing evidence in the literature suggests that mesial temporal sclerosis is the result of excitoxicity to hippocampal neurons at a relatively young age (less than 4–5 years). This explains why these patients frequently have a history of febrile convulsions or another illness associated with convulsions at a young age, followed then by a ‘silent period’ of 5 to 10 years before the actual seizures emerge. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of mesial temporal sclerosis will be essential to eventually prevent the occurrence of such a frequent and devastating disease.

# 34 A NEbeneor cortical temporal lobe epilepsy  

## Introduction  

Temporal lobe epilepsy is usually divided into two different forms, depending on from which part of the temporal lobe the seizures actually originate. The division into mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) and neocortical temporal lobe epilepsy (NTLE) is especially important since each of these epilepsies requires a distinct surgical strategy.  

Compared to MTLE in which the seizure origin is rather circumscribed and essentially confined to the mesial structures, seizures in NTLE may arise from many different foci. Therefore, NTLE resembles other neocortical extratemporal focal epilepsies.  

Historically, the concept of a distinct syndrome of NTLE has developed over recent decades, essentially based on the increasing interest in surgical treatment of intractable focal epilepsies of temporal lobe origin. The distinction between mesial and lateral temporal lobe epilepsies has been made possible through the availability of detailed analyses of seizure symptoms stored on video, together with surface and invasive EEG recordings, as well as the increasingly higher resolution of structural imaging techniques. The most convincing proof of the existence of lateral temporal lobe epilepsy is the successful resection of a neocortical temporal focus leading to seizure freedom.  

### Anatomy of the temporal neocortex  

Figure 34.1 shows the distribution of various types of cortices found in the medial and lateral part of the temporal lobes adapted from Engel.1  

The medial temporal lobe comprises several neural structures, such as the amygdala; the hippocampus together with the adjacent entorhinal and perirhinal cortex; and the parahippocampal cortex, also called the paralimbic areas, including the temporopolar cortex (area 38 from Brodman). Bordering the paralimbic areas are the inferior temporal gyrus containing Brodman area 20 in its anterior and middle part, and area 37 lying in the temporo-occipital junction. Areas 20 and 37 belong to modality-specific association areas. Between the entorhinal area and the inferior temporal gyrus, a strip of high-order association cortex (Brodman area 36) is located.  

The medial temporal gyrus with Brodman area 21 also represents modality-specific association cortex. A second strip of high-order association cortex (Brodman area 36) is located between the middle and the superior temporal gyrus. The superior temporal gyrus contains the primary auditory cortex (Heschl area) with the medial transverse temporal area (Brodman area 41) and the lateral transverse temporal area (Brodman area 42). The other part represents a modality specific association area (Brodman area 22).  

### Functional anatomy  

The main functions ascribed to different regions of both temporal lobes are depicted in Figures 34.2 and 34.3 (adapted from refs 2 and 3). These functions comprise verbal and nonverbal memory, emotional behavior, smell, and hearing.  

### Semiology of seizures arising from temporal neocortex  

#### Aura  

The content of auras in NTLE is produced by ictal activation of functional cortex in which the seizure originates. An auditory aura, for example, is the consequence of ictal activation of the primary or secondary auditory cortex and may indicate that seizure onset is in the Heschl area. However, it is also possible that the seizure origin is in a silent cortical area and spreads from there to the auditory cortex where it produces the first clinical symptom. Thus, the presence of an auditory (or any other sensory) aura always has to be interpreted cautiously in terms of localizing the seizure onset zone. In addition, it is important to be aware of the possibility that seizure activity, especially with neocortical origin, may spread very rapidly, leading to almost simultaneous co-activation of more widespread areas including mesial temporal structures. Thus experiential phenomena, as they were called by Penfield and Jasper, may not be specific for the lateral temporal neocortex. Rather, as was proposed by Gloor,4 reciprocal connections between the limbic structures and the temporal isocortex have to be activated in order to obtain these phenomena. This has also been proposed by Blume et al.,5 who concluded that ictal experiential phenomena represent simultaneous epileptic discharges of the temporal neocortex and the limbic system.  

#### Types of auras reported in NTLE  

Auras described in NTLE depend on the functional areas being activated at seizure onset or early during a seizure. According to the functional anatomy shown in Figures 34.2 and 34.3, several types of experiential or psychical auras6 may occur due to activation of the memory system and, the auditory system, or the visual system.

Figure 34.1 Medial (top) and lateral aspect of temporal lobes showing the supposed distribution of paralimbic (green), high-order (pink), modality-specific (yellow), and idiotypic or primary (blue) areas. This information is mainly based on experimental results in animals. AI: primary auditory cortex, AA: auditory association cortex, IT: inferior temporal gyrus, MT: medial temporal gyrus, ST: superior temporal gyrus, TP: temporopolar cortex, PH: parahippocampal area, VA: visual association cortex. The numbers indicate cytoarchitectonic areas following Brodman’s map of the human brain (from Engel 1989, with permission). (See Color plates.)  

These consist of memory illusions (déjà vu, jamais vu, déjà entendu, jamais entendu, feeling of strangeness) and memory hallucinations (memory flashbacks, dreams of past). Auditory auras can occur as unformed hallucinations (ringing, buzzing, chirping, machine-like) or as more elaborate sounds (voices, music). Auditory illusions can be perceived as advancing or receding, louder or softer, clearer or fainter sounds. Visual hallucinations originating in the posterior temporal association cortex consist of the perception of scenes, objects or faces. Illusions may occur as macropsia, micropsia, seeing objects nearer or farther, clearer or blurred.  

Several reports support the assumption that patients with NTLE have different types of auras when compared with patients with MTLE. Maillard et al.7 investigated 187 stereoencephalography-recorded seizures of 55 patients who were classified into three groups according to their electrophysiologic findings. There were 24 patients whose seizure onset was in the mesial temporal structures, 13 in the lateral temporal cortex, and 18 patients in both medial and lateral temporal areas. Auditory and other sensory hallucinations or illusions occurred significantly more often in the lateral group and viscerosensory and emotional auras in the medial group. However, with the exception of fear and dreamy states, which were not seen in the lateral group, all other auras also occurred in all three groups.  

Gil-Nagel and Risinger8 compared a group of 16 patients with hippocampal seizure onset (proven by seizure freedom after surgery) with a group of 19 patients with extrahippocampal temporal seizure onset. In the first group, 13 patients reported one of the following auras: five reported epigastric auras, three fear, two smell, two somatic, and one gustatory. In the NTLE group 11 patients reported auras mostly of the psychical type, none reported epigastric or emotional auras. Pfander et al.,9 on the contrary, found a relatively high number $(33\%)$ of epigastric auras in a group of 36 patients with NTLE.  

O’Brian et al.10 found no statistically significant differences in the incidence or nature of auras in a group of 31 patients with MTLE compared to 15 patients with NTLE.  

The difference might be explained by different patient populations studied. Psychical auras are more common in patients suffering from NTLE but they are in no way specific to NTLE. In our series of 14 patients with circumscribed lesions affecting the temporal neocortex as revealed by MRI (neocortical temporal lobe epilepsy group: nTLE, Figure 34.4a, b), significant differences were found in auditory/visual auras and epigastric auras: auditory/visual auras were more frequent in the nTLE and epigastric auras more frequent in the mTLE group consisting of 18 patients who were seizure free after temporal lobectomy (Figure 34.5). There was no difference between the two groups regarding other auras (memory illusions, fear, gustatory or none).11

### Seizure semiology  

Epileptic auras occur isolated, i.e., stop before other seizure symptoms follow, or progress to seizure signs that can be observed and analyzed when recorded on video. Many ictal motor manifestations have been described, such as version, clonic and tonic activity, unilateral epileptic spasms, dystonic posturing and unilateral automatisms, automatisms with preserved responsiveness, ictal spitting and vomiting, emotional facial asymmetry, unilateral eye blinking, ictal nystagmus, and akinesia. Furthermore, loss of consciousness, ictal language manifestations and postictal features, such as Todd’s palsy, postictal aphasia, postictal nosewiping, postictal memory dysfunction, as well as peri-ictal water drinking, peri-ictal headache, and ipsilateral tongue biting have been analyzed.12  

Several studies addressed the question whether seizures arising from temporal neocortex exhibit ictal signs that can help to differentiate them from seizures originating in other regions of the brain, most specifically the mesial temporal region.  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/75aecc13-d94b-498f-a57b-d2c2317b2c13/b1da3ffa5070d2e002424fcb259c6f941291991d00916cbb86afea7bf607aefb.jpg)  
Figure 34.5 Comparison of the frequency of auras reported in the mesial and neocortical TLE group. Only epigastric and visual/auditory auras showed a significant difference (Fisher’s exact test).11  

In the study of Maillard et al.7 only initial loss of contact, shorter duration, and more frequent generalizations were associated with neocortical temporal lobe seizures, whereas other investigated signs (oro-alimentary automatisms, vocalizations, verbal automatisms, upper limb automatisms, upper-limb tonic posturing, head and/or eye deviations) when occurring early or late during the seizures were either observed significantly more frequently in seizures of mesial temporal origin or did not show any difference between NTLE or MTLE.  

Gil-Nagel and Risinger8 found that early oral automatisms were significantly more frequent in MTLE than NTLE, whereas early motor involvement of the contralateral upper extremity without oral automatisms occurred significantly more often in NTLE. No difference between NTLE and MTLE was found in arrest reaction, vocalization, speech, facial grimace, postictal cough, late oral automatisms, and late motor involvement of the contralateral arm and hand.  

Pacia et al.13 found a motionless stare at ictal onset the most common behavioral manifestation in NTLE.  

Pfander et al.9 observed early clonic activity following automatisms significantly more frequently in NTLE.  

Holl et al.14 investigated 80 seizures (51 MTLE and 29 NTLE) of 30 patients (20 MTLE and 10 NTLE) with regard to dystonic posturing of the upper limb. Ictal dystonia was subdivided into different subtypes according to distinct clinical features. Their frequency and latency from the clinical onset of seizure were assessed. Frequencies of all subtypes were similar in MTLE and NTLE. Concerning the latencies, contralateral dystonic posturing characterized by sustained muscle contractions with flexion of the wrist and fist closure occurred significantly earlier in NTLE than in MTLE seizures.  

Dupont et al.15 reviewed the videotapes of 60 patients with well-defined MTLE, NTLE, or both to assess the presence and the localizing value of unilateral dystonic posturing associated with motor automatisms. Twenty-eight of the 60 patients exhibited unilateral dystonic posturing. This sign was observed in patients with MTLE and NTLE. It was mostly contralateral to the seizure focus in patients with MTLE and exclusively ipsilateral in patients with NTLE. Unilateral motor automatisms occurred in 26 of the 60 patients with MTLE or NTLE. It was predominantly ipsilateral to the seizure focus in patients with MTLE and exclusively contralateral in patients with NTLE. The association of ipsilateral motor automatisms and contralateral dystonic posturing was found in 14 patients with MTLE but in none of the patients with NTLE. Two patients who had medial and neocortical seizure onset also exhibited this clinical feature. The authors concluded that the association of ipsilateral motor automatisms and contralateral dystonic posturing may help to differentiate MTLE from NTLE with a reliable lateralizing value.  

Contralateral motor automatisms were described by Mirsattari et al.16 in a patient with right temporal neocortical seizures. The authors concluded that early onset unilateral motor automatisms without dystonic posturing can localize the seizure origin to the contralateral temporal lobe neocortex.  

In our own study,11 there was no difference in clinical ictal symptoms when patients with NTLE were compared to patients with MTLE (Figure 34.6).  

The literature about clinical semiology in neocortical temporal lobe seizures shows heterogeneous results, sometimes with contradictory findings. Most studies compared seizures arising from the temporal neocortex with seizures of mesial temporal origin due to hippocampal sclerosis or other mesially located etiologies. At best, what can be concluded from the above cited publications is that experiential auras with auditory and visual content, early behavioral arrest, and rapid generalization may speak in favour of a neocortical seizure origin although this is, by far, not a common finding in all studies reviewed. Ictal symptoms of seizures arising in the mesial temporal structures exhibit a rather uniform pattern, especially when the sequence of symptoms and signs is regarded.17  

Theoretically, neocortical temporal lobe seizures may arise from numerous foci with clinical symptoms and signs reflecting the functional properties of the activated area(s) as well as the different possibilities of spread that are predetermined by the cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical connections.  

### Etiology of neocortical TLE  

In the Epilepsy Surgery Program Bethel 910 patients received resective surgery between 1991 to April 2002. Among those, 610 patients $(67\%)$ had temporal lobe resections of which $60\%$ had pure mesial temporal lobe surgery due to hippocampal sclerosis and another 122 $(20\%)$ had other mesially located etiologies. There were 122 patients $(20\%)$ who had neocortical temporal resection without mesial structures (unpublished data).  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/75aecc13-d94b-498f-a57b-d2c2317b2c13/b4184a42513dd67ed92d9df6410ce0b6e0a3f646059e981a0083ebe49c141a8c.jpg)  
Figure 34.6 Comparison of the frequency of ictal symptoms observed in the mesial and neocortical TLE group. There is no significant difference between the two groups (Fisher’s exact test).11  

Tumors of benign dignity such as gangliogliomas, dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors or neurocytomas, vascular malformations (mostly cavernomas), and malformations of cortical development are among the most frequent chronic structural abnormalities found in neocortical temporal lobe resections.18  

Figures 34.7 (a–f) show examples of different lesions in the MRI scans. Other etiologies encompass posttraumatic and postinflammatory defects.  

Extrahippocampal temporal lesions may coexist with hippocampal sclerosis, a finding which is called dual pathology. It is not clear whether hippocampal sclerosis is the consequence of ongoing epileptic activity originating from a neocortical focus or a coincidental concurrence. Whenever this constellation is found in a patient it creates diagnostic problems when surgery is regarded. The following case should demonstrate this.

### Case report  

A 19-year-old girl suffered from epilepsy since she was 6 months old. Until the age of 15 she occasionally complained about epigastric sensations before seizures, accompanied by loss of consciousness, heavy breathing, and stiffening of the right leg. She had an average of four seizures a month and she failed three first line AEDs before preoperative evaluation was carried out. The neurological examination was normal; her intellectual functions were above average. Her MRI revealed three lesions (Figure 34.8), the largest a cavernoma at the left posterior temporal area, the second a left-sided hippocampal sclerosis, and the third a cavernoma located immediately under the right hippocampus, which was otherwise normal.  

During intensive EEG Video Monitoring over 5 days, three of the habitual seizures were recorded. Interictal EEG showed sharp waves over the left temporal region with a phase reversal either at the left sphenoidal electrode (Figure 34.9a) or at electrode T7 (Figure 34.9b) indicating that the maximum negativity of the interictal discharges occurred at the mesiobasal or the temporal lateral region.  

Ictal EEG consistently started with low voltage fast activity over the left hemisphere maximal at the posterior electrodes (Figure 34.10a) then evolved into a rhythmic $4{-}5\mathrm{Hz}$ theta pattern over the left temporal region (Figure 34.10b).  

Intracarotid amobarbital test and fMRI for language revealed that the right hemisphere was dominant for speech and memory (Figure 34.11).  

Mainly based on the ictal EEG showing a seizure pattern unusual for mesial TLE but in favor of a neocortical left temporal origin an extended lesionectomy of the left posterior vascular malformation guided by intraoperative electrocorticography was carried out.  

The patient has been seizure free for $2\ 1/2$ years despite bitemporally located lesions (see Figure 34.12 corresponding to preoperative MRI and Figure 34.12 showing the postoperative MRI scans).  

### Electrophysiology of neocortical TLE  

As was shown in the case report, surface EEG can provide essential information regarding the seizure origin in some patients. Although there is certainly an overlap in interictal and ictal EEG findings in patients suffering from MTLE and NTLE, interictal epileptiform activity in MTLE usually shows a predominance of discharges at the anterior temporal or sphenoidal electrodes and less often at the mid-temporal or posterior temporal electrodes. Pfander et al.,9 and $\mathrm{^\circ}$ Brien et al.10 investigated electroclinical differences in patients with NTLE and MTLE. Regarding the EEG findings, they found no difference in the interictal EEG. There was an increased frequency of fast rhythmic sharp waves $({>}4\operatorname{Hz})$ in the ictal-EEG of MTS patients (mean $81\%$ vs $60\%$ , $P=0.05$ ). The patients with NTLE developed bilateral ictal EEG changes more often (mean $55\%$ vs $26\%$ , $P<0.05\dot{}$ ) and more rapidly (mean 23s vs 74s, $P<0.005$ ). The onset of ictal EEG seizure activity was bilateral more often in patients with NTLE ( $20\%$ vs $4\%$ , $P<0.005$ ). There were no significant differences between the two groups for any of the video-EEG features, in terms of whether or not the feature occurred at least once in an individual patient. They concluded that there are a number of clinico-electrical differences between patients with mesial MTLE and patients with NTLE, but that none of these are sufficient to allow a distinction to be made in an individual patient. Foldvary et al.20 found a lower mean frequency of lateralized rhythmic activity (LRA) in NTLE ictal EEG recordings that frequently had a hemispheric distribution, whereas LRA in MTLE seizures was maximal over the ipsilateral temporal region. They concluded that it may be possible to differentiate lesional NTLE from MTLE on the basis of historical features, seizure symptomatology, and ictal surface EEG recordings.  

In summary, interictal and ictal surface EEG are important to prove (or disprove) the epileptogenicity of a structural abnormality in the temporal neocortex in patients with epilepsy. Some EEG features are more in favor of a neocortical seizure origin and it might help to place invasive electrodes in patients without an MRI-visible lesion in order to clarify the situation.

### Prognosis  

The postoperative outcome in patients with NTLE due to MRI visible lesions is as good as in patients with MTLE. Patients with clearly identified nonlesional NTLE who were operated on and became seizurefree postoperatively are probably rare and nonexistent in the Bethel series comprising more than 1500 operated cases.  

Two recent studies have investigated prognostic factors in NTLE. In the study of Janszky et al.,19 more than two-thirds of the patients with NTLE became seizurefree postoperatively. Lateralized/localized EEG seizure pattern and tumors on the MRI were associated with postoperative seizure-freedom, while focal cortical dysplasias (FCD) were associated with a poor outcome. The 6-month postoperative outcome was a reliable predictor for the long-term outcome. Yun et al.31 found that the presence of a focal lesion on MRI, correct localized hypometabolism on FDG-PET, or localized ictal rhythms on EEG are predictors of a seizure-free outcome.

# 35 Premotor and central lobe epilepsy  

## Anatomy  

### Structural anatomy  

Premotor cortex is part of the lateral frontal lobe, which extends from the central sulcus to the frontal pole. Its upper and lower limits are the fissura longitudinalis and the sulcus lateralis, respectively. The surface is formed by the gyrus precentralis between central and precentral sulcus and the superior, medial and inferior gyrus frontalis, which are divided by the superior and inferior frontal sulcus. The inferior frontal gyrus again is subdivided into the triangular, orbital, and opercular part.  

The lateral surface of the central lobe consists of gyrus precentralis and postcentralis, which are located between sulcus precentralis and postcentralis and divided by the sulcus centralis. The mesial part of the central lobe consists of the lobulus paracentralis between the precentral sulcus and the ramus marginalis of the cingulate sulcus.  

Microanatomically, the frontal lobe cortex is part of the neocortex. Therefore, its cortex consists of six neuronal layers. Brodmann subdivided and numerated 52 areas of different cytoarchitectural patterns.1 Considerable variability has been found in the extent of cytoarchitectonic areas in relation to macroanatomical landmarks, especially in the premotor region.2–4 Cytoarchitectonic findings and their relationship to gyri and sulci connect the structural anatomy to localization of cortical functions as described below.  

### Functional anatomy  

The central lobe contains the somatotopically organized primary motor and sensory cortex (Brodmann area 4 and 3, respectively). Historically, the sulcus centralis was thought to be the border between motor and sensory areas,5 but more recent studies suggested both motor (tonic or clonic and ‘negative motor’, i.e., motor arrest) and sensory responses after electrical stimulation of the gyrus precentralis as well as in gyrus postcentralis.6  

In primates, central lobe neurons receive their main input from thalamus and secondary motor and sensory regions, while their efferences form a considerable part of the pyramidal tract: $30{-}50\%$ of the pyramidal tract fibers arise from primary motor and around $25\%$ from primary sensory cortex. These neurons control kinematic and dynamic parameters of movement rather than single muscles.4  

The lateral frontal cortex is usually subdivided in premotor and prefrontal cortex.7  

The premotor cortex contains the secondary motor area (Brodmann area 6 in the posterior parts of the frontal gyri), the frontal eye field (Brodmann area 8 at the intersection of sulcus precentralis and superior frontal sulcus) and Broca’s language region (Brodmann areas 44 and 45 at the opercular and triangular parts of the inferior frontal gyrus in the dominant hemisphere).  

In primates, the secondary motor area is organized roughly somatotopically, receives input from thalamus, primary motor cortex and parietal lobe and sends projections to the spinal cord, the superior colliculus, and the reticular formation. It is involved in planning and controlling movements in response to somatosensory and visual information.4  

The frontal eye field (Brodmann area 8) is located at the intersection of sulcus precentralis and superior frontal sulcus.8 Its main function is the control of intentional saccades. Therefore, it receives input from occipital and parietal lobe.  

Broca’s language area (Brodmann areas 44 and 45) is located at the opercular and triangular parts of the inferior frontal gyrus in the dominant hemisphere.2 Connections with Wernicke’s temporal speech area and primary motor cortex are necessary for its function in speech production.  

The supplementary sensorimotor are a (SSMA) also belongs to the premotor cortex and is located in the mesial frontal lobe.  

The lateral frontal lobe surface between premotor cortex and frontal pole is sometimes referred to as prefrontal cortex. Its function is only vaguely defined and covers executive control, monitoring in working memory, learning, temporal structuring of behavior and control of behavior by context.9 Few specific regions were identified which were recruited by different demands indicating a prefrontal network involved in solution of diverse cognitive problems.  

## Epidemiology  

Data on incidence and prevalence of frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE) differ widely between general population, patients referred to epilepsy centers, and surgical series. Additionally, various criteria of estimating the location of the epileptogenic zone are used which hampers comparison of study results.  

### Population-based studies  

In 594 patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy, $42\%$ were found to suffer from partial epilepsy.10,11 In this patient group, the symptomatogenic zone was localized as follows:  

primary motor cortex $12\%$ primary sensory cortex $4\%$  

overlapping (motor and sensory) central regions $8\%$ one or more frontal regions anterior to the primary motor cortex $14\%$   
frontotemporal $4\%$   
(together: $42\%$ ).  

However, EEG and CT results revealed a strong variance with the seizure semiology in $20\%$ of the patients. This shows the limited value of seizure semiology as single feature for localization of the epileptogenic zone. Reasons for overestimation of frontal lobe epilepsies defined by seizure semiology might be the large extension of eloquent cortex in the frontal and central lobe and the impressive presentation of motor signs in the course of seizures compared to more subtle symptoms of seizures that start in other cortical areas.  

Another population-based prospective study12 used seizure semiology, EEG, and imaging results for classification of epilepsy syndromes according to ILAE criteria.13 Of 1,016 patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy, $43\%$ suffered from either symptomatic or cryptogenic partial epilepsy. Of those, $26\%$ had frontal lobe epilepsy and $5\%$ parietal lobe epilepsy which included the postcentral part of the central lobe.  

In general, the frontal or central lobe appear to be involved in $30\mathrm{-}40\%$ of all newly diagnosed partial epilepsies.  

### Hospital-based studies  

Patients with extratemporal epilepsies might be referred less frequently to presurgical video-EEG monitoring compared to temporal lobe epilepsies due to unclear results in seizure semiology and interictal EEG and MRI findings that make eligibility for surgery difficult. Frontal lobe epilepsy was found in $10{-}27\%$ of adult patients14–17 and in $18{-}21\%$ of children18–20 who were referred to epilepsy centers.  

Using a newly-proposed five-dimensional epilepsy classification [21] instead of the ILAE classification, the epileptogenic zone was found to be localized in the frontal lobe in $4\%$ and in the perirolandic area in $3\%$ of 94 randomly selected adult patients of a tertiary epilepsy center; in $7\%$ of 91 children the epileptogenic zone could be localized to the perirolandic area and no child with frontal lobe epilepsy was identified.22 The differences with previous evaluations may reflect the influence of various classification systems on assessing the diagnosis.  

### Surgical series  

Underrepresentation of frontal lobe epilepsy in surgical series might occur due to the same reasons as stated for presurgical monitoring. A serial of 2177 patients who had undergone epilepsy surgery stated central lobe epilepsy in $7\%$ and epilepsy of (remaining) frontal lobe in $18\%$ .23 Another study included 124 consecutive patients and found frontal lobe epilepsy in $15\%$ of the patients.24  

## Etiology  

### Brain tumors  

Of all patients with brain tumors, $25\mathrm{-}75\%$ develop seizures.25,26 Infiltrating well-differentiated tumors localized in the forebrain have the highest risk to be accompanied by seizures.25  

Frontal lobe involvement was accompanied by a high epilepsy risk of $40{\-}45\%$ . Patients with tumors involving both frontal and parietal lobe (therefore including central lobe) showed seizures in $58\%$ of the cases.  

Presurgical and surgical series of patients with extratemporal neocortical27 or frontal lobe23,28–31 epilepsy reveal an incidence of brain tumors of $13\mathrm{-}35\%$ . In particular, astrocytoma was found in $10\%$ (with higher incidence of low grade tumors), ganglioglioma in $5\mathrm{-}10\%$ , oligodendroglioma in $3{-}10\%$ , and dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET) in $1-5\%$ of all frontal lobe epilepsy patients. In other surgical series, $15{-}30\%$ of DNET were found to be located in the frontal lobe.32,33  

### Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD)  

FCD are cortical lesions that contain architectural abnormalities like dyslamination, immature or giant neurons, balloon cells of neuronal or glial origin, and/or dysmorphic neurons. In frontal lobe epilepsy, cortical malformations were found in $20{-}84\%^{18,28-31,34,35}$ and are associated with positive family history of seizures, lower IQ, neurological deficits, multiple seizure types of early onset, and frequent status epilepticus.36 A series of 14 consecutive children ${<}7$ years with frontal lobe epilepsy revealed FCD in all cases.37 These data were consistent with earlier seizure onset in patients with FCD compared to other etiologies.28  

FCDs can be divided into two subclasses: type 1 without dysmorphic neurons or balloon cells, and type 2 containing dysmorphic neurons and/or balloon cells (‘Taylortype FCD’).38 Type 1 FCDs were found to be located frequently in the temporal lobe while type 2 tends to occur more often extratemporally, especially in frontal and central lobes.39 Patients with FCD type 2 have a higher seizure frequency.40  

### Vascular malformations (VM)  

Vascular malformations include arteriovenous malformations (AVM), cavernomas, teleangiectasias, and venous malformations and occurred in $7-15\%$ of patients with frontal lobe epilepsy.30,31,41  

Arteriovenous malformations (AVM) were detected in $6\%$ of frontal lobe epilepsies.28  

About $20{-}40\%$ of all supratentorial cavernomas are located in the frontal lobe.42–44 $25\mathrm{-}80\%$ of cavernoma patients develop seizures42,43,45; accordingly, in $9\%$ of FLE patients cavernomas were found.28 Frontal lobe cavernomas presented less frequently with seizures than temporal lobe cavernomas did ( $45\%$ vs. $70\%$ ).44 Compared to other locations, frontal lobe cavernomas might have a higher probability of causing generalized seizures.43  

Venous malformations and dural AVM do no seem to cause seizures.45  

### Genetic causes  

There are two types of idiopathic focal epilepsies related to frontal or central lobe: Benign epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes (BECTS) and autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE).  

ADNFLE is genetically heterogeneous and can be caused by mutations of genes coding for subunits of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.46 BECTS has been classified as idiopathic (and therefore with a presumed genetic etiology) by the ILAE13; however, the lack of concordance in twin studies makes the classification doubtful.47  

### Other etiologies  

Other etiologies include gliosis, e.g., due to head trauma $(11-28\%~^{23,28-30})$ , postinflammatory scars (up to $10\%^{23}$ ), and birth trauma (up to $8\%^{23}$ ). Frontal lobe arachnoid cysts were detected in 4 of 867 epilepsy patients $(0.5\%)$ , but only 1 of the cysts was located near the irritative or seizure onset zone48 which makes their relationship with epilepsy unlikely.  

In up to $20\%$ of frontal lobe epilepsy cases, no underlying pathology can be found.23,29  

## Diagnostic evaluation  

### Determination of the symptomatogenic zone–Seizure semiology  

Most clinical studies concerning seizure semiology in frontal lobe epilepsies estimate location of the epileptogenic zone by defining the symptomatogenic, irritative, or seizure onset zone as well as epileptogenic lesion and may therefore include patients with epileptogenic zones outside frontal or central lobe, whereas studies of patients who became seizure free after frontal lobe resection are not representative for the group of patients who can be treated nonsurgically.35 Moreover, many studies do not distinguish between certain regions of frontal lobe.  

According to functional anatomy described above, central lobe seizures may be accompanied by focal somatosensory auras and focal motor signs:49,50  

Focal somatosensory auras are specific for involvement of central lobe. On the other hand, nonspecific auras occur in the majority of patients with frontal lobe epilepsy.29,51 Focal motor signs contain tonic, dystonic, clonic and complex motor symptoms. Asymmetric tonic limb posturing occurs more frequently during seizures with temporal onset than in frontal lobe seizures.7 Using EMG and subdural EEG electrodes, it has been shown that clonic seizures are preceded by a tonic phase which is sometimes too short to be recognized clinically.52 Repetitive EEG spiking in primary motor areas during the initial tonic phase is followed by spike wave complexes and synchronous clonic contraction of both agonistic and antagonistic contralateral muscles. EEG spiking matches muscle contractions whereas relaxation occurs synchronized with EEG slow waves.  

Seizures involving the lateral premotor cortex may present with the following symptoms:49,50  

Contralateral version that precedes secondary generalization in half of the seizures.53,54 Version has to be distinguished from the rarer nonforced head-turning of unknown pathophysiology without any clonic or pronounced tonic component which frequently appears at seizure onset.53 Both forms can appear successively in the same seizure.  

Aphasia, dysphasia or vocalization may occur if Broca’s language area is involved. Pure vocalization other than those caused by cloni or apnea sound was seen in $40\%$ .55 Another study of 26 FLE patients reported articulate vocalization with uttering of words or swearing in $31\%$ , while $42\%$ of the patients produced other sounds.56 Surprisingly, prolonged postictal dysphasia occurred in less than $10\%$ of 118 complex partial frontal lobe seizures of 24 patients.57 The dysphasia was of short duration even if the seizure onset zone was located in the dominant hemisphere; on the other hand, seizures starting in the frontal lobe of the dominant side and spreading to the ipsilateral temporal lobe caused long-lasting postictal dysphasia in ${>}90\%$ . Low distance between seizure onset zone and anatomical location of Broca’s speech area (determined by electrical cortical mapping) did not correlate with appearance of postictal language disturbances. This finding suggests a disruption of temporal speech networks rather than direct influence on cortical speech areas as the cause for dysphasia.  

Seizures involving prefrontal cortex can present with complex motor seizures including automotor, hypermotor and gelastic seizures.58  

Hypermotor seizures (complex movements involving trunk and proximal limb segments, e.g., bicycling movements, as well as screaming, jumping, running around, or aggressive sexual automatisms), which are considered to be specific for frontal lobe epilepsy with special relation to lesions of frontopolar and orbitofrontal cortex,49 occur frequently at night and tend to cluster.29 It can be difficult to distinguish hypermotor seizures from psychogenic seizures. Behavioral symptoms like mood change, unexpected quietness, subtle change of awareness or awakening are other features of prefrontal seizures.59 Unlike seizures involving primary motor or sensory areas, the complex semiology of prefrontal seizures may be caused rather by disruption of neuronal synchrony between different brain regions than by excitation of single cortex areas (Table 35.1).60  

#### Cluster analysis of seizure evolution  

Because the described seizure semiology usually does not occur isolated, the analysis of characteristic clusters has be performed.49 Three seizure patterns have been found to be of localizing value in lateral frontal or central lobe epilepsy:  

Somatosensory aura with or without Jacksonian march, often followed by tonic posturing and head version or clonic seizures (Video). Automatisms and vocalization are rare in this seizure pattern. As expected, there is a strong association with central lobe lesions. Focal (tonic-)clonic seizures with Jacksonian march without secondary generalization, usually accompanied by ipsilateral head version and followed by postictal paresis. This seizure pattern is also associated with central lobe lesions. Version or posturing occurring early during the seizure evolution, frequently followed by other motor manifestations like simple automatisms. This seizure sequence is associated with lesions of the premotor cortex.

General features of frontal and central lobe seizures Seizure frequency varies within a wide range. At least in surgical series, high frequency of several seizures per day is not rare in FLE,29 but in patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy no significant differences in average seizure frequency were found between various partial epilepsies.10  

Frontal lobe seizures tend to cluster especially at night times. More than half of the patients experience status epilepticus in their history which may even appear periodically in some patients.29  

The duration of partial seizures arising from the frontal lobe is reported to be significantly shorter than the duration of temporal lobe seizures and does usually not exceed 1 minute.29,51 Another study49 did not confirm these results concerning the average seizure duration, but noted also that extremely short seizures $_{(<10\ s)}$ were more likely to occur in frontal lobe epilepsies.  

Secondary generalization occurs in up to $70\%$ of the patients during lifetime.29 However, the hypothesis that secondary generalization was more frequent in frontal lobe epilepsy than in other epilepsies could not be confirmed in more recent studies.51  

Frontal lobe seizures were found to occur more frequently during non-REM-sleep than temporal lobe seizures.66 However, this feature is of little clinical value to distinguish both syndromes in individual patients, because patients who develop seizures during sleep are seen in both epilepsy syndromes.29,66,67  

Postictal headache (migraine-type, tension-type or unclassified) occurred in $41-53\%$ after frontal lobe seizures.61,62 The more posteriorly the seizures start, the more frequent is the migraine-type postictal headache (occipital lobe $20\%$ , temporal lobe $10\%$ , frontal lobe $5\%$ ).61 In contrast to temporal lobe epilepsy in which the side of the headache was found to be ipsilateral to the seizure onset zone in $90\%$ , there seems to be no lateralizing value of postictal headache in frontal and central lobe epilepsy.62  

In children with FLE, the immature cortex architecture might influence seizure semiology; the lack of automatisms and secondary generalization has been attributed to this feature.37  

### Determination of the irritative zone  

#### Interictal EEG  

Interictal spikes or sharp waves appear in $60\mathrm{-}80\%$ of frontal lobe epilepsies (Figure 35.1); they are considered to be of less localizing value than in temporal lobe epilepsy because they can be bilateral, multilobar, or even generalized.26,35,68–70 However, as far as the lateral frontal lobe is involved both interictal and ictal EEG findings are of higher localizing value.71 Concordance of the epileptogenic zone with the irritative zone was found in $72\%$ of the patients with lateral FLE compared to $33\%$ with mesial FLE.72 Possible reasons for this difference are the smaller distance between lateral cortex areas and scalp electrodes and the fact that tangential dipoles in mesial FLE cannot be detected by EEG.  

The use of closely spaced surface electrodes other than those of the 10–20-system may improve localization if the irritative zone but did neither increase EEG sensitivity in 23 patients with frontal or central lobe epilepsy nor did it help in lateralizing the irritative zone in those patients who had bilateral epileptic discharges in conventional EEG.73  

The sensitivity of interictal EEG is higher in intracranial subdural than in scalp recordings. Due to the closer distance to cortex, subdural electrodes may reveal a smaller extent of the irritative zone in some patients than surface electrodes do. However, a sampling bias remains in invasive monitorings.69  

Pre-excision epileptiform activity during intraoperative electrocorticography recorded from ${>}2$ lateral frontal lobe gyri and central lobe predicts a poorer surgical outcome while postresection absence of spikes or sharp waves other than those at resection borders strongly correlates with a favourable surgical result.74,75  

#### Magnetoencephalography (MEG)  

Registration and localization of interictal discharges using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and magnetic source imaging (MSI; MEG co-registered with MRI) has been shown to be of predictive value for surgical outcome in some FLE patients.76 Of 21 FLE patients who were considered for invasive monitoring, nine had no epileptic EEG discharges.77  

In three of these patients, MEG showed interictal epileptic discharges. Especially patients with lateral neocortical localization of the irritative zone and patients whose epilepsy was caused by focal cortical dysplasia seemed to benefit from MEG investigation. Hence, combination of MEG with EEG can be helpful for tailoring the placement of invasive electrodes.  

### Determination of the seizure onset zone Ictal EEG  

Short seizure duration, fast cortical spreading and frequent muscle artifact in seizures with early motor signs as well as the large portion of frontal lobe cortex that is ‘hidden’ to scalp electrodes due to its far distance and vertical orientation restrict the value of ictal EEG recordings in frontal lobe epilepsy.78 Again, this restriction applies more to mesial than to lateral frontal lobe epilepsy: seizures originating in the mesial frontal lobe were found to propagate faster than dorsolateral frontal seizures.79 Ictal scalp EEG in 127 seizures of 15 patients with lateral frontal lobe epilepsy showed correct localization of the epileptogenic zone in $65\%$ of the patients, while $26\%$ of the seizures started with generalized EEG activity and $3\%$ were mislateralized in the EEG analysis.80 Only $1.5\%$ of the seizures were obscured by artifacts or did not show EEG changes at all. The most frequent EEG patterns at seizure onset were repetitive epileptiform activity $(36\%)$ (Figure 35.2), rhythmic delta $(26\%)$ and EEG suppression $(14\%)$ . Rhythmic theta activity, the most frequent seizure pattern in temporal lobe epilepsy, was seen in only $9\%$ . A smaller study of nine patients also comparing medial and lateral frontal lobe epilepsy found that absence of focal electrographic seizure activity excluded the possibility of dorsolateral frontal lobe seizures with a negative predictive value of $93\%$ .71  

Although scalp electrodes showed widespread seizure onset and MRI was read as normal or nonlocalizing, the use of subdural grid electrodes that covered extensively frontal areas were reported to localize the seizure onset zone in ${>}90\%$ by several authors.79,81  

#### Ictal single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)  

An early report about exploration of the seizure onset zone in 22 children with frontal lobe epilepsy using ictal 99TcHMPAO-SPECT showed hyperperfusion in $91\%$ and correct localization in $95\%$ of the cases.82 However, newer data on adults did not confirm these promising results. Localization of seizure onset was found in only $33\mathrm{-}43\%$ of frontal lobe epilepsy patients.83–85  

Subtraction ictal SPECT co-registered to MRI (SISCOM) as well as the combination of ictal SPECT with near-infrared spectrospcopy (NIRS) has increased diagnostic sensitivity,86–88 but sufficient data on frontal lobe seizures are not yet available.  

### Determination of the epileptogenic lesion  

#### Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  

Surgical series showed MRI-lesions in $46{-}97\%$ of the patients28,29,31,68,89–91 (Figure 35.3). In 38 children, the rate of lesions detected by MRI were found to be only $32\%$ compared to $97\%$ in 17 children with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.20 Presence of an MR lesion strongly correlates with a good surgical outcome: $25\mathrm{-}41\%$ of patients without MRI lesions became seizure free or had only nondisabling seizures after surgery as compared to 67–72% of MR-positive patients.70,89,90 According to the frequent etiologies of frontal lobe epilepsies, inclusion of FLAIR and proton weighted series for detection of dysplasias and blood products is recommended.51,92,93

MRI review by experienced neuroradiologists can remarkably improve its sensitivity.94  

## Additional and experimental methods  

Despite its low spatial resolution, MR spectroscopy can help to lateralize and even localize epileptogenic frontal and central lobe lesions by detection of reduced N-acetylaspartate levels.95,96  

The area of decreased N-acetylaspartate concentration frequently exceeds the epileptogenic lesion as seen in MRI.97  

Diffusion tensor imaging may be helpful for detection of the epileptogenic lesion in patients without structural changes on conventional MRI, especially in patients with focal cortical dysplasia.98–100 Furthermore, multiplanar reconstruction and curvilinear reformatting were shown to improve the localization of focal cortical dysplasias in the frontal lobe.101  

Unlike in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, postictal diffusion weighted MRI may be helpful in detection of the seizure onset zone in selected patients with FLE.102  

### Determination of the functional deficit zone  

#### Interictal single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)  

Interictal 99Tc-HMPAO-SPECT is of little value in neocortical epilepsy: areas of hypoperfusion have been found in only $24\%$ of patients without MR-abnormalities, and these areas did not match the epileptogenic or seizure onset zone.103 In 22 children with frontal lobe epilepsy, only two had interictal localized hypoperfusion that was concordant with clinical, EEG, MRI, and pathological findings.82 Therefore, performance of interictal SPECT seems to be reasonable only together with ictal SPECT.  

#### Positron emission tomography (PET)  

The overall sensitivity of $^{18}\mathrm{F}$ -fluorodeoxyglucose-PET (FDG-PET) scans in frontal lobe epilepsy was reported to be $46{-}96\%$ .104 There is a correlation between MRI lesions and pathologic results in FDG-PET: hypometabolism was found in about $75\%$ of patients with unilateral frontal lobe epilepsy and MR abnormalities.14,105 However, only in $29-45\%$ of patients without MR-detectable lesion but electroclinical features of unilateral frontal lobe epilepsy localizing hypometabolism were seen in FDG-PET.14,83,105 In a prospective study PET revealed pathological findings in no patient with bifrontal epilepsy and normal MRI.14 Flumazenil-PET for detection of low benzodiazepine receptor density showed only a slightly higher sensitivity to lateralize cryptogenic unilateral frontal lobe epilepsy. The method did not contribute significantly to localization of the epileptogenic zone.  

The sensitivity for $^{18}\mathrm{F}$ -fluorodeoxyglucose-PET was found to be $92\%$ in children with frontal lobe epilepsy while the specifity for frontal lobe lesions was only $62\%$ and additional hypometabolism outside frontal regions could be detected frequently.106 Hence, the value of $^{18}\mathrm{F}$ -Fluorodeoxyglucoseand flumazenil-PET seems to be restricted in frontal lobe epilepsy compared to temporal lobe epilepsy,14 although sensitivity can be slightly increased by use of statistical parametrical mapping.107 The role of alpha- $\big[\mathrm{^{11}C}\big]$ methyl-Ltryptophan-PET remains to be determined because only small case series have been published.108  

#### Neuropsychological examination  

The published studies on neuropsychological deficits in frontal lobe epilepsy do not differentiate between certain cortical areas. Impaired motor programming and coordination together with reduced response inhibition can be found in about two-thirds of frontal lobe epilepsy patients and may contribute to differentiate them from patients suffering from temporal lobe epilepsy, while speed, attention, and memory span does not differ between the epilepsy syndromes.109 An exception might be the patients with right-sided frontal lobe epilepsy and early seizure onset $^{\prime}{<}6$ years) in whom motor skills were found to be less impaired than in patients with frontal lobe epilepsies of the left side or later onset.110  

### Estimation of the epileptogenic zone  

Ictal EEG, seizure semiology, and MRI are most important for estimation of the localization and extent of the epileptogenic zone. If seizure semiology, MRI, PET, and SPECT results are pointing to a certain frontal lobe region, intracranial EEG may be abdicable.111 In MR-positive cases, pure lesionectomy without further attempt of locating the epileptogenic zone led to at least $95\%$ seizure reduction in 13 of 14 patients with central lobe epilepsy.112  

Difficulties arise especially  

if non-invasive investigations reveal equivocal results; in patients without MRI-detectable lesion;   
in patients with close relation of the epileptogenic zone with eloquent cortex; and   
in patients with focal cortical dysplasia because of the ill-defined lesion margins.  

In those patients, invasive EEG monitoring is frequently required.17,113,114  

### Determination of the eloquent cortical areas  

The detection of eloquent cortical areas is crucial prior to and during resection of central lobe cortex due to the motor representation in this area.  

Pre-and intraoperative localization of the central sulcus by use of SEP is possible in ${>}90\%$ of the cases; however, the method may fail in patients with tumor etiology in which the anatomical cortex structure is deranged.41,69,115 Magnetoencephalographic responses evoked by electrical stimulation of the median nerve can also help to locate the central sulcus.116 Electrical cortical stimulation via implanted grid or strip electrodes has the highest validity for cortical mapping. Reproducibility of seizure symptoms during cortical stimulation is associated with good outcome in extratemporal epilepsy, if these areas were included in the resection.81  

## Therapy and outcome  

### Medical therapy  

In general, medical therapy leads to seizure freedom in about two-thirds of patients with newly diagnosed focal or generalized epilepsy.117 There are few data on medical therapy of frontal lobe seizures. Medical therapy led to seizure freedom in $37\%$ of 200 patients with difficultto-treat frontal lobe epilepsy who were referred to a tertial epilepsy centre.15 In one open-labeled nonrandomized study, a combination of valproate and lamotrigine was used in 21 patients, of whom $48\%$ were seizure free after 1 year of treatment and another $29\%$ experienced seizure reduction of at least $50\%$ .118 However, the use of additional antiepileptic drugs was allowed. A similar seizure freedom rate of $50\%$ was seen in 22 retrospectively observed children with frontal lobe epilepsy.119

### Surgical therapy  

Resective surgery: seizure outcome and prognostic factors In older series, $13\mathrm{-}55\%$ of patients with frontal lobe epilepsy had a favorable outcome after surgery;23,28,35 a metaanalysis showed an overall seizure freedom rate of $27\%$ .120 However, since diagnostic capabilities (especially neuroimaging) improved, seizure freedom, or an outcome with nondisabling or very rare seizure was reported in up to $60{-}70\%$ .28,29,68,121–123 In patients without MRI-detectable lesions, Engel class I outcome was achieved in $43\%$ of 35 FLE patients.83  

Acute seizures within the first week after resection occurred in around $25\%$ of patients after frontal lobe epilepsy surgery, particularly in patients who develop intracerebral hematomas; an association with long-term outcome could not be proven.124 During five postoperative years, seizure outcome improved in $15\%$ and deteriorated in $5\%$ of frontal lobe epilepsy patients.125  

Neuropsychological benefits (e.g., improvement of short term memory) may occur in patients who become seizure free after frontal lobe resection.126  

The following factors have been found to be associated with good postoperative outcome in patients with frontal lobe epilepsy by several authors:30,70,122,123,127–132  

Tumor or post-traumatic etiology;   
Focal MRI lesion;   
Focal lesion or normal result in FDG-PET;   
Focal ictal $\upbeta$ -activity in EEG at seizure onset;   
Slow spreading of EEG seizure pattern; Localization of the resection in lateral frontal lobe;   
Seizure control within first year after resection.  

On the other hand, the following factors seem to be associated with poor outcome:30,31,70,114,123,127  

Autonomic seizure symptoms;   
Etiology of focal cortical dysplasia;   
Contralateral head version;   
Eye deviation (any direction);   
Incomplete resection;   
Generalized slowing or generalized interictal epileptiform discharges (IED) in presurgical EEG;   
Postsurgical IED in scalp EEG;   
Additional extrafrontal lesions;   
Localization of the resection in medial frontal lobe;   
Childhood febrile seizures.  

Some factors could not be shown to correlate with the outcome:30,31,83,122,123,127,129  

Age at operation;   
Age at onset;   
Epilepsy duration;   
Seizure frequency;   
Seizure duration.  

However, it has to be pointed out that the prognostic value of several above mentioned features was not corroborated by other authors. For example, most studies revealed a strong correlation between presence of MRI-detectable lesions and favorable seizure outcome,30,122,127 while other data showed no correlation123,132 or even better results in patients with normal MRI.29  

#### Complications  

Neurological deficits after lesionectomy (paresis, hypesthesia, dysphasia, abulia, incontinence) appeared in $15\mathrm{-}40\%$ after frontal lobe resection, but only $1-3\%$ of the deficits persisted.28,35,123  

Resection of primary hand and arm motor cortex leads to contralateral paresis. Functional recovery starts within 1–3 weeks, but fine motor skills do not recover completely.133 Due to crossing fibers leading to bilateral representation, resection of axial, face, and tongue motor areas usually recovers completely, and so does sensory function after removal of postcentral cortex.133,134  

#### Vagus nerve stimulation  

Vagus nerve stimulation reduces seizure frequency by at least $50\%$ in $30\mathrm{-}40\%$ of patients, whereas efficacy increases  

over time.135 No specific data on premotor or central lobe epilepsy are available.  

#### Other and experimental methods  

If resective surgery is impossible due to overlap of the epileptogenic zone and eloquent cortex, multiple subpial transsections (MST) and callosotomy remain as further surgical approaches.  

Three months after MST in the frontal lobe, $30\%$ of the patients were seizure free in one study.126 However, the long-term seizure freedom rate is probably far lower.120  

In patients without localizing diagnostic results, callosotomy is a palliative option.136 Freedom of most disabling astatic seizures can be achieved by this procedure in $35\%$ .120  

Other methods like deep brain or cortical stimulation or focal cortical cooling are still experimental.

# 36 Mesial frontal epilepsy  

## Introduction  

The unusual semiology of seizures arising in the frontal lobes; frenetic asynchronous movements, bilateral posturing and partial awareness often presents diagnostic challenges to physicians. Epilepsy surgery assessments are beset by the brevity of the seizures, the speed of seizure propagation within and beyond the frontal lobe and the limitations to resection imposed by sensorimotor and language cortex. Seizure foci within the mesial frontal lobe add to the challenge by their remoteness to scalp EEG electrodes, propensity to transcallosal spread and bilateral hemisphere involvement and difficult surgical access.  

A clinical syndrome of mesial frontal lobe epilepsy is not easy to define because of the anatomical complexity and interconnectivity of the mesial frontal lobe, the non-specific seizure semiology and the diverse pathologies of symptomatic frontal lobe epilepsy. The mesial frontal lobe contains primary motor cortex for the lower limb, the supplementary sensorimotor area, and the anterior cingulate motor area. Each of these motor areas is interconnected, within and between hemispheres, and receives input from subcortical nuclei and the parietal lobe. There are non-eloquent anterior cortical regions that give no clue to seizure onset before propagation within and beyond the mesial frontal lobe. Despite the potential pitfalls a knowledge of the anatomy of the mesial frontal lobe and its connections, typical seizure semiology, scalp EEG patterns and surgical experience can guide the assessment of patients with intractable partial seizures suggesting mesial frontal lobe involvement or identified mesial frontal lobe pathology.  

### Anatomy of mesial frontal lobe  

#### Cortical surface  

The mesial frontal lobe contains portions of each of the major divisions of the frontal lobe; primary motor cortex, premotor cortex and prefrontal cortex. Conventional MRI scans in sagittal and axial views can identify critical boundaries between primary motor and premotor cortex (Figure 36.1 and 36.2). The cingulate gyrus can be identified above the corpus callosum and curves around the genu of the corpus callosum anteriorly (Figure 36.1). The cingulate sulcus is easily identified above the gyrus. It may be divided anteriorly with the two sulci running roughly parallel around the genu of the corpus callosum.1 Posteriorly the cingulate sulcus ceases to run parallel to the corpus callosum and travels superiorly as the marginal ramus to the parasagittal surface of the brain. The marginal ramus is the posterior boundary of the frontal lobe mesially and divides the primary sensorimotor cortex of the paracentral lobule from the precuneus (mesial parietal lobe). The most rostral aspect of the central sulcus can be identified immediately anterior to the marginal ramus in sagittal MRI views.2 The central sulcus usually does not enter the interhemispheric fissure3 and sagittal planes just lateral to the midline are best used to locate it in relation to the marginal sulcus. The superior frontal gyrus occupies much of the mesial surface of the frontal lobe anterior to the paracentral lobule. It is divided from the paracentral lobule by the paracentral sulcus, in continuity with the cingulate sulcus, and passes forward to form the frontal pole. Inferior to the anterior portion of the superior frontal gyrus a number of gyri run obliquely toward subcallosal region becoming parallel with the gyrus rectus of the orbitofrontal cortex. The anterior inferior aspect of the mesial frontal lobe is contiguous with the orbitofrontal cortex. The superior frontal gyrus and central sulcus are also seen well in axial MRI views of the brain (Figure 36.2). The superior frontal sulcus, the lateral boundary of the superior frontal gyrus, ends posteriorly in the precentral sulcus, an interrupted sulcus when traced laterally. The uninterrupted central sulcus can be followed laterally in successive caudal axial images and a characteristic $\mathbf{\dot{\Omega}}^{\prime}\mathbf{\Omega}^{\prime}$ shaped bend in the central sulcus identified.4 This feature of the precentral gyrus has proven to be a reliable cortical landmark for the hand region of the motor cortex based upon cortical stimulation and evoked potential studies.4,5  

### Functional anatomy  

Classical functional divisions of the frontal lobe motor areas into primary, premotor and supplementary motor regions do not adequately convey the complex reciprocal connectivity of mesial frontal motor areas with lateral frontal regions, striatum, thalamic nuclei and the parietal lobe.6 The mesial surface of the frontal lobe includes primary sensory and motor cortex for the lower limb, the supplementary motor area, the anterior cingulate motor areas, anterior cingulate cortex and the prefrontal cortex.7 Because of the coincidence of motor and sensory responses with cortical stimulation of the supplementary motor area, the term supplementary sensorimotor area has been proposed.8 Specific subregions of these cortical areas can be distinguished based upon the inputs and projections between these mesial frontal areas and subcortical nuclei, the parietal lobe and lateral frontal motor areas.  

The supplementary sensorimotor area (SSMA) is found in the mesial portion of the superior frontal gyrus anterior to the primary motor area for the lower limb extending to approximately the level of the genu of the corpus callosum. The inferior border is formed by the cingulate sulcus but the superior border has no clear cortical landmark. Cortical stimulation studies have suggested the SSMA extends onto the dorsolateral aspect of the superior frontal gyrus8–11 although Talairach and Bancaud12 concluded that the SSMA was only found on the mesial surface. The precentral sulcus may be a more reliable landmark defining the border between the primary motor foot area and the SSMA than the paracentral sulcus as the primary motor cortex may not occupy a great portion of the paracentral lobule.2,13,14

Figure 36.2 Axial cut of a 3D reconstruction of an MRI of the brain showing frontal and parietal lobes. The rostral end of the central sulci are indicted (small arrow heads) in the right and left hemispheres. The superior frontal gyrus (sfg) occupies the parasagittal region. The characteristic $\bar{\Omega}$ shaped bend in the central sulcus is seen in the left hemisphere, the $\Omega$ symbol lies over the precentral gyrus at this point. This portion of the precentral gyrus is a reliable anatomical landmark for the hand motor cortex.  

Motor responses to electrical stimulation of the SSMA are characterised by the simultaneous activation of axial, proximal and distal muscle groups. Tonic muscle contraction with posturing of the trunk and limbs is usually seen rather than focal clonic activity.8,11,15–17 Simultaneous activation of more than one extremity is common and bilateral movements of the limbs occur.8,11,16 Arrest or slowing of voluntary motor activity occurs11,18 and these negative motor responses result from the anterior portion of the SSMA.8 Sensory responses to cortical stimulation can be obtained from the mesial frontal cortex and parietal cortex inferior and posterior to the paracentral lobule.11,18 These ‘supplementary sensory’ responses are not as precisely localised by the patient as those occurring in response to stimulation of the primary sensory cortex in the postcentral gyrus. Motor responses have also been obtained posterior to the paracentral lobule.8  

The SSMA is located in the mesial portion of area 6 of Brodmann’s cytoarchitectonic map of the brain corresponding to the Vogts’ areas 6aα and $6\mathrm{a}\upbeta$ .18,19 Immunohistochemical and microstimulation studies in primates and functional imaging studies in humans have shown that the anatomical SSMA is not a single functional region.6,19 There is an anterior (‘pre-supplementary motor area’) region, interconnected with the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate motor areas, involved in motor processing of other parietofrontal circuits. Detailed cytoarchitectural studies in human brains has shown this region corresponds to the mesial portion of area $6\mathrm{a}\upbeta$ and a more posterior ‘supplementary motor area-proper’ is formed by the mesial portion of area 6aα.14 In the primate the supplementary motor area-proper has significant connections with the primary motor cortex and spinal cord and important reciprocal connectivity with the mesial parietal regions.20 The SSMA is a non-primary motor area involved in preparing voluntary movements with the primary motor area responsible for the execution of the movement.19 The supplementary motor area-proper seems more important for postural control and movement execution while the rostral pre- supplementary motor area has more ‘supramotor’ programming function.20  

Human cortical stimulation studies have found a topographic representation of the body within the SSMA. Motor responses are more concentrated within the posterior portion of the classically defined supplementary motor area,12 and within this region eye movements responses lie most anteriorly followed by upper limb and then lower limb movements as one moves posteriorly. Negative motor responses are located anterior to positive motor responses.8 Support for this somatotopic organisation of the SSMA can be found in functional neuroimaging studies of cerebral blood flow with motor activation21 and recording of movement-related cortical potentials.22  

The anterior cingulate cortex lies inferior, rostral and superior to the corpus callosum and accounts for a significant portion of the mesial frontal cortex. It is made up of Brodmann areas 32, 24, 25 and 33. In addition to the premotor functions of the anterior cingulate motor areas, lying deep within the cingulate sulcus, the anterior cingulate cortex is involved in the regulation of autonomic and endocrine function, affect, emotional vocalisation, pain perception and cognitive processing for response selection.1 The anterior cingulate cortex receives input from multiple thalamic nuclei. Its projections reach the skeletomotor system via the spinal cord, red nucleus and pons, the striatum, the limbic system via amygdala and the midbrain periaqueductal grey, and the autonomic system via the solitary tract and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus.1 It is not surprising that electrical stimulation of the human anterior cingulate region has produced an enormous variety of autonomic, emotional and complex motor responses. Cingulate stimulation may produce changes in heart rate, blood pressure, facial flushing, pupillary dilation and may induce nausea, salivation, bladder or bowel evacuation.1,23,24 Emotional responses such as fear, agitation, pleasure and euphoria and repetitive simple and complex motor actions may occur.1,23,24 The prefrontal cortex anterior to the SSMA and cingulate motor cortex is relatively silent when subject to cortical stimulation although reciprocally connected to the pre-supplementary motor area.  

### Vascular anatomy  

The anterior cerebral artery is the major arterial supply of the mesial frontal lobe with only a small contribution from distal branches of the superior division of the middle cerebral artery to the lateral aspect of the superior frontal gyrus. The anterior cerebral artery courses from the circle of Willis to the parietoocciptial area and shows great anatomical variation between individuals.25–27 The orbitofrontal cortex, the mesial anterior frontal lobe, the superior frontal gyrus, cingulate gyri, paracentral lobule and anterior corpus callosum are all supplied by branches of the anterior cerebral artery.25,26 The proximal anterior cerebral arteries may be very asymmetric with dominance of left or right, and branches of the callosomarginal or pericallosal may cross the midline to supply the contralateral mesial frontal lobe.26 Thus the occlusion of one anterior cerebral artery may lead to bilateral mesial hemispheric infarction and is a potential complication of surgery in the mesial frontal regions.  

A ‘C’ shaped inferior portion of the mesial frontal surface surrounding the corpus callosum, including cingulate gyrus and inferior aspect of the superior frontal gyrus, drains in to the deep cerebral venous system to the straight sinus. The more rostral and anterior arc of mesial frontal cortex and the parasagittal lateral convexity drains via the superficial cortical veins to the superior sagittal sinus. The superior anastomotic vein of Trolard travels between the superficial middle cerebral vein in the sylvian fissure and the superior sagittal sinus. It can be identified on lateral venous phase angiograms and the surface of the cerebral convexity at craniotomy. It runs parallel and adjacent to the central sulcus.  

The superficial venous system is very important in planning the placement of subdural electrode arrays and cortical resections in the mesial frontal region. The passage of proximal superficial cortical veins to the sagittal sinus anchors the parasagittal convexity to the dura at several points and may indeed limit what can be introduced in to the interhemispheric fissure. These large but distensible veins are exposed to any subdural electrode arrays and may be compressed and thrombose especially if patients are not kept well hydrated postoperatively.13  

## Seizure semiology  

The seizures associated with mesial frontal lobe epilepsy share the common features of frontal lobe seizures; abrupt onset, short duration and clusters of multiple daily seizures. The bilateral asymmetric tonic seizure28 is most often linked to the mesial frontal lobe. These seizures have attracted different labels over the years; ‘postural seizures’,29 ‘supplementary motor seizures’,30 or asymmetric tonic motor seizures.31,32 This seizure semiology is not specific for mesial frontal lobe onset and other distinct semiologies may also be seen with mesial frontal lobe onset. These include the uncommon ‘frontal lobe absence seizures’33 with motionless staring, ‘frontal lobe complex partial seizures’34–36 with hyperkinetic motor automatisms, repetitive vocalisations and agitation, focal clonic seizures of the lower limb and negative myoclonus. Focal clonic seizures involving the face and upper limb, or versive seizures are not typical of a mesial frontal onset. Complex partial seizures with oral and manual automatisms (psychomotor seizures typical of mesial temporal lobe onset37 are not typical but may be seen with seizure onset within the cingulate gyri.1  

### Bilateral asymmetric tonic seizures  

Bilateral asymmetric tonic seizures are characterised by an abrupt onset of tonic posturing, maintained for 10-40s and not followed by any postictal stupor or confusion.38–40 Typically the tonic posturing appear to be bilateral from the onset but careful analysis has revealed it may begin in one part of the body and move rapidly to the other limbs.41 Less often posturing may be unilateral or restricted to a single limb but proximal limb and axial muscle involvement is always prominent.39 Most often all 4 limbs are involved with abduction of the upper limbs and asymmetric flexion of the elbows. The lower limbs are abducted at the hips with the knees extended or semi-flexed.39 Penfield described ‘the arm being raised and the head and eyes turned as though to look at the hand’ and this has been referred to as the ‘fencing posture’.18a Clinical series show the assumption of a true fencing posture is uncommon.34, 38, 42  

The patient’s posture may change during the seizure if the distribution and intensity of muscle contraction changes. Patients may also attempt to change their position during the seizure and show coarse incoordinate movements of their tonically postured limbs. They may cry out (perhaps cursing) or moan loudly at the onset.43 Patients are unresponsive during the tonic phase of the seizure but do not lose consciousness during brief bilateral asymmetric tonic seizures and words or instructions given during a seizure can be recalled. Longer seizures, as may be seen with antiepileptic medication withdrawal during prolonged video/EEG studies, may be associated with some ictal amnesia and postictal confusion.44 Focal clonic activity may occur due to involvement of the primary motor cortex34,42 and may appear late with seizure spread or precede the tonic phase if the epileptogenic zone includes the primary motor cortex.  

A somatosensory aura may immediately precede the tonic seizure. This may be a feeling of tension, pulling or heaviness in a limb or the sense of the limb ‘being about to move’18,39,45 or more simply a ‘tingling’ feeling. The symptoms may arise from the sensory representation within the supplementary sensorimotor area8,16 or may be the awareness of tension developing in muscle groups involved in the tonic contraction. The sensation may be relatively focal involving a portion of a limb, lateralised with both upper and lower limbs involved simultaneously or a less well defined bilateral sensation in the head or body.18,39,45  

Although evidence exists to support ictal involvement of the supplementary sensorimotor area in producing bilateral tonic posturing, the seizure onset may be outside the mesial frontal region or outside the frontal lobe itself. Subdural and depth electrode monitoring has shown the seizure onset zone and epileptogenic zone commonly extends beyond the supplementary sensorimotor area to primary motor cortex, the dorsolateral premotor cortex, the cingulate gyrus, the mesial prefrontal cortex and the mesial parietal lobe.34,35,38,46 Patients with seizures arising exclusively from the SSMA are rare $^{34,35,38}$ and the seizure semiology of such patients can not be distinguished from that occurring in patients with ictal onset’s that included adjacent cortical areas.34,38 Surgical series have shown the typical bilateral asymmetric tonic postural seizures described above may occur in patients with ictal onset, confirmed by surgical outcome, in lateral frontal, parietal or occipital lobes.40,47–52 Similar observations have been made in a clinical series comparing seizure semiology to clinical localisation based upon lesion location.53 Detailed analysis of the evolution of seizure semiology in patients with bilateral tonic seizures can provide some features to distinguish between focal onset within frontal and parieto-occipital regions54 but one must consider an extra-frontal onset in all cases of non-lesional epilepsy.  

These observations suggest that the epileptogenic zone in patients with bilateral asymmetric tonic seizures may be outside the mesial frontal lobe with this seizure semiology arising by propagation of ictal discharges to the one or both SSMA in the mesial frontal lobe. This concept is well supported by the primate anatomical studies of fronto-parietal connectivity.6 Evidence for such propagation has been limited in human studies45,55 as invasive electrode placement will always be concentrated in the proposed area of resection and there will be limited sampling regions of seizure onset and propagation.56 More recently Ikeda et $a l^{52}$ found good evidence of seizure propagation to the SSMA from epileptogenic regions outside the mesial frontal region to coincide with the asymmetric tonic semiology. Dorsolateral frontal regions and mesial parietal cortex gave rise to seizures which immediately spread to electrodes implanted over the SSMA.  

A more challenging question is whether ictal involvement of cortical (dorsolateral premotor areas and cingulum) and subcortical motor regions (basal ganglia) other than the SSMA may be capable of producing the bilateral asymmetric tonic seizure semiology.34,57,58 Apparently isolated ictal involvement of either the lateral premotor area or the primary motor area can produce tonic motor activity.34 The tonic motor activity was manifest as unilateral posturing of a limb or limbs (contralateral to the ictal activity) and usually associated with clonic motor activity. Unilateral tonic limb posturing without clonic activity was seen in $2/13$ seizures in the patients with ictal discharges limited to the primary motor area.34 Cortical stimulation of frontal convexity premotor areas in primates can produce contralateral tonic motor activity in proximal muscle groups but not bilateral or ipsilateral motor responses.59-61 Intraoperative62,63 and extraoperative64,65 cortical stimulation studies in humans have not revealed convexity premotor (Broddman area 6, or Vogt and Vogt area 6a alpha) responses distinct from primary (area 4) motor responses but the convexity premotor motor responses are not bilateral. At present there seems to be good evidence for a central role for the SSMA as the symptomatogenic zone for bilateral asymmetric tonic seizures with preserved awareness but questions remain regarding the participation of other cortical motor areas and subcortical systems.  

### Hypermotor seizures  

Complex partial seizures characterised by vigorous sometimes bizarre motor automatisms, vocalisation and relatively minor postictal confusion are often seen in frontal lobe epilepsy and have been distinguished from those associated with mesial temporal lobe seizure onset.35,66,67 The complex movements resulting in repeated changes in posture and asynchronous perseverative proximal limb movements, have been termed ‘hypermotor seizures’ in the semiological seizure classification proposed by Lüders et al.68 Patients may have wild repetitive movements of the outstretched hands, kicking or pedalling of legs, hopping, pelvic thrusting or genital mani pulation.69,70 Vocalisation is common and may be loud and intrusive and socially disabling.66,70,71 The vocalisation is often primitive consisting of grunting or barking sounds but can consist of intelligible phrases repeated over and over. Patients may be partially responsive during the episodes, occasionally have some recall of the events and often have minimal postictal disorientation. Because of the bizarre character of the episodes and the rapid recovery these seizures may be mistaken for pseudoseizures or behavioural outbursts.70,72 However, the stereotyped nature of the events and the loss of awareness should point an experienced physician toward epilepsy. There may be an overlap between the hypermotor and the bilateral asymmetric tonic postural seizure semiology as axial tonic activity may be present whilst the patient struggles and attempts to change position.58 Both hypermotor and tonic postural seizure types may be brief lasting less than 30-40s, may be predominantly nocturnal, and have minimal or no postictal confusion although completely preserved awareness is not as common with the hypermotor semiology.  

This seizure semiology is not well localised within the frontal lobe and has been described with orbitofrontal seizure onset73–76 and lateral frontal seizure onset.42,77 While seizure onset in a number of frontal regions may produce this seizure semiology the anterior cingulate region has most often been discussed as the cortical region responsible for the clinical signs and symptoms.78 Seizures with onset in the anterior cingulate gyrus are characterised by these vigorous automatisms and vocalisations78 and stimulation induced complex motor behaviours are similar to these automatisms when the anterior cingulate region has been explored with invasive electrodes.1,23 Ictal single photon emission computerised tomographic scans (SPECT) studies have demonstrated hyperperfusion of the frontopolar regions in children with complex gestural automatisms, vocalisation and hyperventilation.76,79 The hypermotor seizure has been though to have some specificity for a frontal lobe onset35 but more recently seizure onset within temporal neocortex80 or insular cortex81,82 has been shown to also produce the typical hypermotor seizure semiology.  

### Frontal lobe absences  

Motionless staring with amnesia may occur in seizures arising from the mesial frontal cortex, so called ‘frontal absences’.33,83 Bancaud and Talairach described seizures characterised by impairment of consciousness, speech and movement arrest, simple gestural automatisms and immediate recovery of consciousness.33 The duration varies, they may be as brief as 10s and are usually between 15-45s. Compared with the absences of childhood absence epilepsy frontal lobe absences may have subtle repetitive vocalisation, rocking movements, small degrees of head and eye turning and some brief postictal confusion.1,33,84,85 The patient may report awareness of a motor arrest without loss of consciousness.86 The staring may evolve into a secondarily generalised tonic clonic seizure via version of the head and eyes, focal tonic posturing of an upper limb or bilateral tonic posturing.33 Episodes of status epilepticus are characterised by subtle alteration in responsiveness or mood, and variable degrees of stupor may occur.86–88 Patients with absence seizures in frontal lobe epilepsy seem to have a more anterior epileptogenic zone than those with bilateral asymmetric tonic seizures.33 The clinical semiology has been ascribed to bilateral cingulate gyrus involvement in the seizure1,89 via the callosal route.90 However, the common association of bilateral synchronous frontal interictal discharges and the coincidence of clinical and scalp EEG seizure onset suggest a rapid entrainment of both frontal lobes in the ictus possibly via thalamocortical pathways involved in the production of idiopathic generalised absence seizures.33  

### Negative myoclonus  

Epileptic negative myoclonus is characterised by brief lapses of postural tone usually with dropping of an outstretched limb. The muscles need to be activated for the clinical manifestation and it is not seen when muscles are at rest. Frontocentral epileptiform discharges immediately precede the atonia. Most commonly focal negative myoclonus occurs in association with a central seizure onset in cases of idiopathic focal epilepsy of childhood.91 In symptomatic partial epilepsy foci have been demonstrated in primary sensorimotor cortex92 and dorsolateral premotor areas.93 The association focal negative myoclonus and asymmetric tonic seizures has been noted with mesial frontal seizure onset.94 The electromyographic correlate of negative myoclonus is a brief $(<500\mathrm{ms})$ silent period not preceded by any electromyographic evidence of myoclonus.95 It has been reported with direct cortical stimulation via subdural electrodes the primary sensorimotor cortex could produce a silent period but not the SSMA.96 Rubboli et al.95 performed cortical stimulation via depth electrodes of premotor cortex, primary motor cortex, primary somatosensory cortex and the supplementary sensorimotor area at low frequency. They found a motor evoked potentials most often preceded the silent period for primary motor and premotor cortex, low but not high intensity stimulation produced an isolated silent period from primary sensory cortex but the SSMA consistently produced only a silent period.95  

### Lateralising and localising signs  

It is true that all of the frontal lobe seizure semiologies discussed with this chapter have limited localising value for subdivisions of the frontal lobe.58 It is most important to be aware the distinctive semiology of the bilateral asymmetric tonic seizures does not have localising value for an onset within or adjacent to the SSMA.52,97 Lateralising signs have not been well studied in frontal lobe epilepsy. Consistently unilateral sensory symptoms are usually contralateral to the hemisphere of onset. Focal clonic activity reliably lateralises seizure onset to the contralateral hemisphere34,42 and focal tonic posturing has a similar lateralising value.58,98,99 Unilateral tonic posturing is not as common as bilateral asymmetric tonic posturing. The position of the arms, elbow extension vs flexion, is not a reliable guide to lateralisation of seizure onset. Head turning as part of a bilateral asymmetric tonic seizure is not a reliable lateralising sign.58 Head turning occurring early in the seizure may be contralateral18,34 or ipsilateral44,100 to hemisphere of seizure onset. Head version, with clonic movement, occurring immediately prior to secondary generalisation to a generalised tonic clonic seizure is more reliable lateralising sign.101 Unifocal or unilateral somatosensory aura is a reliable sign appearing contralateral to the hemisphere of onset.58  

### Interictal and ictal EEG  

Several factors often combine to reduce the localising value of interictal and ictal scalp EEG in frontal lobe epilepsy; the inaccessibility of mesial frontal and orbitofrontal cortex to scalp EEG electrodes, the rapid propagation of seizure discharges within and between frontal lobes and movement artefactc.35,56,102,103 The interictal EEG in patients with mesial frontal lobe epilepsy most commonly shows an abundance of nonlateralised epileptiform activity or none at all.38,70,85,89,104–108 Quesney and colleagues from the Montreal Neurological Institute109 have examined interictal epileptiform activity in 34 patients seizure free after selective frontal lobe excisions and compared parasagittal resections with anterofrontal and fronto-opercular resections. None of the parasagittal group (10 patients) had focal discharges, 5 had exclusively bilateral or generalised discharges, 4 had regional frontocentral discharges and one had no discharges. Localised epileptiform activity appears to be more common in lateral frontal lobe foci.108,109 Quesney et al.109 found only two of 18 anterior resections and none of 6 fronto-opercular resections had exclusively bilateral or diffuse discharges. In another series scalp EEG revealed no interictal epileptiform discharges in $7/9$ patients with mesial frontal lobe epilepsy confirmed by intracranial EEG.107 An absence of interictal discharges has not been reported in the lateral frontal lobe resections.108,109  

Focal interictal spikes and sharp waves at or adjacent to the midline have been reported in other series of patients with tonic postural seizures.39,45 In a group of 16 patients with bilateral asymmetric tonic seizures, scalp EEG’s recorded during long-term video/EEG monitoring showed midline frontocentral interictal epileptiform discharges in $50\%$ of the patients.45 Blume et al.106 found a similar incidence of midline $(\mathrm{Fz},\mathrm{Cz})$ (5 patients) or frontal (F4, F3) (2 patients) spike foci in a group of 13 patients with ‘supplementary motor area epilepsy’. Examination of the EEG with montages using the midline electrodes, Fz, $\mathrm{Cz}$ and $\mathrm{Pz}$ , is essential as discharges maximal at these electrodes may have a very limited field.39,105,110 Midline discharges present only during sleep can be difficult to distinguish from vertex sharp waves of sleep. Polyspikes and spikes with a prominent aftergoing slow wave will suggest epileptiform activity rather than sleep transients.105 Normal sleep transients have a broad symmetric field and the addition of parasagittal 10-10 system electrodes may be helpful in documenting a persistent asymmetry of the electrical field of midline epileptiform discharges.39,105 Identification of the same midline sharp waves or spikes during wakefulness will of course distinguish them from sleep transients.  

Bilateral synchronous discharges are characteristic of but not specific to mesial frontal epilepsy85,111 having been reported in orbitofrontal, lateral frontal foci and extrafrontal parietal lobe epilepsy.74,76,112,113 Subtle lateralisation may be present in patients with bilaterally synchronous frontal discharges and recording during sleep is important if lateralising information is not to be missed.106,111,114,115 Such lateralisation may be misleading, Blume and Oliver found interictal discharges maximal contralateral to the hemisphere of seizures origin in 2/8 patients with mesial frontal lobe epilepsy and secondary bilateral synchrony. Subtraction techniques may reveal consistent lateralisation in bi-frontal discharges not obvious when examined in bipolar montages.116 Epileptiform discharges and regional slowing may also be present in frontopolar, parietal and occipital regions. This may be an indicator of seizure onset in extrafrontal regions106 but it has also been reported as a misleading finding.108  

The interictal EEG may show only non-epileptiform slowing in mesial frontal lobe epilepsy.39 Intermittent rhythmic midline frontocentral slowing is seen in patients with bilateral asymmetric tonic seizures38 and in patients with midline parasagittal epileptic discharges.105 Ciganek117 described a similar activity in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy although an association between this pattern and epilepsy was not confirmed in a large series of routine EEG studies.118  

Muscle activity is prominent from the onset of bilateral asymmetric tonic seizures and the EEG is frequently contaminated with considerable electromyographic (EMG) and movement artefact. Electroencephalographic seizure patterns may still be evident at the vertex where EMG activity is least and transverse montages will usually demonstrate this best. Characteristic findings include an initial high amplitude slow wave transient or midline sharp wave followed by bilateral frontocentral low voltage fast activity or electrodecrement.38,39,105,111,115,119 Electrodecrement will usually evolve into low voltage fast activity and then bilateral frontocentral or generalised rhythmic theta slowing.38 The low voltage fast activity and the rhythmic slow activity may either be localised to the vertex or be more diffuse. Subtle lateralisation of these rhythms may occur but in general the lateralising information from ictal EEG is minimal.106–108 This was the case in an excellent study looking at the localising and lateralising value of ictal scalp EEG recording in well defined focal temporal and extratemporal epilepsy.120 Seizures from mesial frontal lobe foci most commonly showed paroxysmal fast activity $(33\%)$ or electrodecrement $(29\%)$ as the initial ictal pattern whereas seizures of lateral frontal lobe epilepsy showed repetitive epileptiform discharges $(36\%)$ or rhythmic delta at onset $(26\%)$ . Foldvary and colleagues found only $25\%$ of mesial frontal lobe epilepsy seizures correctly localised or lateralised and $75\%$ had nonlateralised patterns.120 Lateral frontal lobe epilepsy showed $65\%$ of seizures to be correctly localised with an additional $6\%$ correctly lateralised. Bautista et al.108 found seizures originating in the dorsolateral region had focal ictal EEG patterns correctly localising to the region of seizure onset108 but none of their 5 patients with mesial frontal lobe seizure onset had focal ictal EEG patterns.108 An absence of any ictal or immediate postictal EEG slowing has been reported in patients in mesial frontal lobe epilepsy.39,108 In Foldvary’s study just over $50\%$ of the seizures examined were obscured or showed no EEG change in the mesial frontal lobe group, an uncommon occurrence in the other focal epilepsy subsets.120 The demonstration of an EEG seizure pattern may require examination of multiple recorded seizures to detect a subtle but reproducible pattern.  

## Aetiology of mesial frontal epilepsy  

In symptomatic focal epilepsy arising from mesial frontal lobe the surgical specimens have the range of pathologies associated with all extratemporal surgical series. No unique pathologies exist for the mesial frontal lobe. Encephalomalacia, developmental tumours and malformations of cortical development predominate. There are seizure free surgical cases with non-specific findings presenting a cryptogenic category and raising the possibility of sporadic cases of autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy appearing in the refractory series.  

Early surgical series excluding tumours have identified ‘meningocerebral cicatrix’ or gliosis as the commonest pathology related to a past history of head trauma, postinfectious scarring or birth injury.121 Talairach et $a l^{122}$ reviewed the aetiology in 100 patients with frontal lobe epilepsy undergoing surgery and also found a large percentage of patients with birth injury $(18\%)$ , encephalitis $(15\%)$ , and postnatal head injury $(15\%)$ . Tumours were present in 10 patients in the Paris series.122 A variety of neoplasms have been associated with intractable partial seizures in frontal lobe epilepsy including gangliogliomas, gliomas (low grade gliomas, astrocytoma, oligodendrogliomas) and hamartomas.70,77 An aetiology could be identified in 15/18 patients with refractory tonic postural seizures undergoing surgery at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation;43 7 had tumours including ganglioglioma and astrocytoma, 5 had regional cortical dysplasia and 3 had encephalomalacia related to remote infarction, previous cerebral abscess and head injury. In another series of 5 patients with mesial frontal lobe onset seizures; 3 had cortical dysplasia, 1 oligodendroglioma and 1 gliosis with a normal MRI.108 Other pathologies include vascular malformations (cavernoma, thrombosed arteriovenous malformation)123 and tuberous sclerosis.124  

The literature on FLE is dominated by patients seen in comprehensive epilepsy centres with intractable seizures being assessed for epilepsy surgery. There are more benign frontal lobe epilepsies with tonic postural and hypermotor seizure semiology.125–127 Vigevano and Fusco125 described 10 children with ‘hypnic tonic postural seizures’, without neuroradio logical lesions who became seizure free with carbamazepine treatment. The seizures began at an early age and there was a family history of epilepsy in 8 of the patients. Frontal lobe epilepsy with autosomal dominant inheritance has been described with clusters of brief nocturnal motor seizures with tonic postural semiology or the hypermotor semiology.126,128,129 While one cannot be sure of a mesial frontal lobe onset on the basis of seizure semiology alone, ictal SPECT evidence of regional hyperperfusion in the fronto polar and mesial frontal regions has been reported in these patients.130 Onset is usually in childhood, mean 11.7 year, but a wide range of ages at onset is seen from 2 months to 52 years.126 Not all of these patients are well controlled, the family history of epilepsy can be difficult to elicit and sporadic cases are thought to occur.126,127 It is possible patients with idiopathic frontal lobe epilepsy are included in non-lesional surgical series.131 A consistent feature in surgical series of frontal lobe epilepsy is the report of patients with no identified aetiology and non-specific findings in surgical specimens, yet some of these patients become seizure free in long term follow-up.122,124  

### A clinical syndrome of mesial frontal lobe epilepsy?  

Tonic postural seizure semiology has often been presented as evidence for a diagnosis of mesial frontal lobe epilepsy.39,115,125,126,132 However the tonic postural seizure is not specific for a seizure onset within the mesial frontal region or even the frontal lobe itself.35,97 Additional evidence to support a mesial frontal lobe seizure onset may provided from structural neuroimaging studies showing circumscribed lesions53,123 or functional neuroimaging such as positron emission tomography (PET)133 and ictal SPECT.76 Vertex or anterior frontal scalp EEG abnormalities105,114 may be misleading and are not sufficient alone as support for a mesial focus.35,134 Evidence of mesial frontal lobe seizure onset and involvement on the basis of invasive subdural or depth electrode studies is more rigorous a basis of case selection than semiology and scalp EEG.33,34,43,45,50,135–137 However, intracranial electrode evaluations suffer from inherent sampling errors. Frontal epileptogenic regions are often large and there is rapid and complex seizure propagation patterns between cortical and subcortical regions.35,50,134,134a Series based upon seizure free outcome after frontal resections are the ‘pure culture’42, 121 from which seizure syndromes might be derived but the patients are not always separated into anatomical subsets such as mesial or lateral frontal lobe epilepsy and the patients only represent intractable symptomatic partial epilepsy with diverse aetiologies.

These caveats should caution us against accepting too readily a clinical syndrome of mesial frontal lobe epilepsy as there is remarkable diversity in terms of aetiology and prognosis once one gets beyond seizure semiology. The brevity, frequency and nocturnal occurrence of tonic postural seizures are not exclusive to the mesial frontal lobe epilepsy.70,77 The predilection for tonic postural seizure onset during sleep may mitigate the disability arising from intractable epilepsy. There are several series examining surgical strategies in patients with seizures involving the supplementary sensorimotor area that provide some additional clinical details relevant to symptomatic mesial frontal lobe epilepsy.13,45,123,124,136–138 In patients with medically refractory epilepsy tonic postural seizures very often occur daily and clusters of 5–20 seizures per day are not uncommon.45,123,138 The majority of patients in surgical series have seizure onset at an early age: at the Cleveland Clinic; 17 patients, mean 10.4 years, range 3.5 to 22 years,139 in Grenoble; 18 patients, mean age 7 years, range 6 months to 22 years,137 at Yale University School of Medicine; 7/8 patients, had onset at 15 years or younger.138 Normal neurological examinations and average intelligence are more commonly reported than focal signs or severe intellectual disability138,139 although others have found a higher incidence of abnormal neurological signs. In the series of 100 frontal lobe surgery cases from St. Anne’s Hospital in Paris $60\%$ had motor or sensory signs and a third of these had intellectual deficits.122 Specific neuropsychological deficit profiles have not emerged for mesial frontal lobe epilepsy to distinguish it from other subsets frontal lobe epilepsy.140–142 A high incidence of abnormal interictal behaviour and psychiatric illness has been reported in patients with cingulate epilepsy.1,85

# 37 Basal frontal lobe epilepsy  

## Introduction  

For neuroscientists and clinicians alike the basal frontal cortex is one of the least explored and least understood regions of the cerebral cortex.1 Studies of the connectivity of the orbitofrontal region by invasive tract tracing in animals, and less invasive methods in humans, suggest that this region is part of a widely distributed network involving cortical and subcortical projections within the frontal lobes and limbic system.  

Unlike seizures arising from other cortical sites, seizures originating from within the orbitofrontal region have not been extensively characterized in the existing literature. Several factors have tempered our understanding of basal frontal lobe epilepsy including the lack of a characteristic semiology and electroencephalographic findings, the inaccessibility of this region to surface electrodes and the resulting need for invasive recordings in order to demonstrate ictal onset within the orbitofrontal region. Not surprisingly, surgical experience in patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy is relatively limited, when it comes to resections restricted to the basal frontal area.  

The functional heterogeneity and widely disseminated connections of the basal frontal areas account for the protean clinical manifestations of seizures arising from this region. In this chapter we will review the anatomical and functional aspects of the orbitofrontal region and examine the characteristics of the few cases of basal frontal lobe epilepsy that have been reported in the literature.  

### Anatomic considerations  

The basal surface of the frontal lobes (Figures 37.1 and 37.2a) is anatomically divided from front to back into right and left orbital cortices, right and left anterior perforated substances (which are partially covered by the temporal poles) and the midline interpenduncular (or intercrural) area.2 The orbital surface of each frontal lobe is literally located ‘above the orbit’ and houses the orbitofrontal cortex, which is part of the prefrontal cortex.  

Given that there is no single functional role or cytoarchitectonic structure common to all portions of the basal frontal area (as opposed to, say, the primary motor area or the primary visual cortex) the term orbitofrontal cortex may be somewhat misleading. The region is perhaps best described as the orbitofrontal region. Another term that is occasionally used to define this area is the term ‘basal frontal lobe’. While this terminology intuitively suggests the anatomic location of the region under consideration, it may be confused to incorporate components of the basal ganglia that are intimately related to the fiber tracts of the frontal lobe. Therefore, we prefer to refer to this collection of structures as the orbitofrontal region (OFR).  

#### Gross anatomy  

Sulcation patterns in this region are highly variable. In most cases however, three principal sulci are noted on the basal (orbital) surface of the frontal lobe: the lateral and medial orbital sulci and the H-shaped sulcus. The two longitudinal orbital sulci (lateral and medial) divide the orbitofrontal region into lateral and medial orbital gyri and an intermediate orbital cortex3 (Figure 37.1).  

The lateral orbital sulcus separates the orbital lobe from the lateral surface of the frontal lobe (from the inferior frontal gyrus).   
The medial orbital sulcus is synonymous with the olfactory sulcus – the longitudinal sulcus in which the olfactory tract and bulb are located. At its caudal end, the olfactory tract divides into the medial and lateral olfactory striae. Between these two striae lies a rhomboid-shaped region, the anterior perforated substance, whose other two boundaries are the optic tract (posteriorly) and the proximal anterior cerebral artery (ACA) postero-medially. Posterolaterally, it continues into the uncus and medially, it is continuous with the subcallosal gyrus. The anterior perforated substance is perforated by several minute blood vessels (including some lenticulo-striate arteries) arising from the ACA and the carotid artery and supplying several deep subcortical structures.4   
The H-shaped orbital sulcus lies in the largest section of the OFR – the intermediate region – and varies significantly among individuals. The typical H-shape is formed by two longitudinal rami, which are linked by a transverse ramus (the latter is also known as arcuate orbital or transverse orbital sulcus). This H-shape is not commonly seen; rather the name $\mathrm{^{\circ}H}$ -shaped sulcus’ encompasses the complex sulci situated in the central region of the orbital lobe.2,3  

The orbital sulci form five gyri on the basal surface of the frontal lobe. These are (from lateral to mesial):  

(1) The lateral orbital gyrus, located between the lateral orbital sulcus and the H-shaped sulcus;   
(2) and (3) The anterior and posterior orbital gyri situated on each side of the transverse ramus within the confines of the longitudinal rami of the H-shaped orbital sulcus;   
(4) The medial orbital gyrus located between the H-shaped and the medial orbital sulcus; and   
(5) The gyrus rectus, which lies along the medial margin of the orbital lobe and extends over the medial surface of the frontal lobe

Figure 37.1 The basal surface of the frontal lobe – fresh cadaveric specimen. The two longitudinal orbital sulci (lateral and medial) – black arrows – divide the orbitofrontal region into lateral and medial orbital gyri and an intermediate orbital cortex.  

Given the considerable variability with regards to the shape of the orbital sulci and gyri, some neuroanatomists prefer to generically label the convolutions between the olfactory sulcus and the inferior frontal gyrus (F3) as orbital gyri, and all of the corresponding sulci as orbital sulci.5  

The anterior and posterior limits of the OFR are the frontal pole and the anterior perforated substance respectively. The frontal pole is a transitional area between the lateral, medial, and orbital surfaces of the frontal lobe.2 The three longitudinally oriented frontal gyri (superior, middle and inferior) are interrupted by transverse folds, the transverse frontopolar gyri. A fairly constant and deep sulcus, the frontomarginal sulcus,3 separates the transverse frontopolar gyri dorsally from the frontomarginal gyrus ventrally. The frontomarginal gyrus, can therefore be considered to constitute the inferior part of the frontal pole and to mark the boundary between the fronto-polar and orbital regions.  

The inferior frontal gyrus (F3) merges into the orbital region, where the pars orbitalis (the most rostral part of the inferior frontal gyrus) continues into the caudal part of the lateral orbital gyrus and the posterior orbital gyrus. The continuation of the superior (F1) and middle frontal (F2) gyri in the orbital lobe is considered arbitrary.2 In general, the medial orbital gyrus and the gyrus rectus are linked to the superior frontal gyrus (F1). Similarly, the anterior orbital gyrus and the rostral part of the lateral orbital gyrus are considered part of the middle frontal gyrus (F2).  

#### Cytoarchitecture  

Several investigators have developed cytoarchitectonic maps of the OFR in humans and monkeys. The pioneering investigations of Brodmann,6 while detailed in other brain regions, were relatively cursory in the OFR. His maps of this region were essentially restricted to charting areas 10, 11, and 47.7  

Subsequent studies of the same region in primates revealed that the cortex on the orbital surface of the frontal lobe can be categorized as Brodmann Area (BA) 14 medially (corresponding to the gyrus rectus), and 13 caudally. As it extends laterally to the inferior convexity the orbitofrontal cortex corresponds to BA area 12 caudally and 11 anteriorly (anterior orbital surface). Finally, the frontal pole corresponds to BA 10. There is now general agreement that the cyto-architecture of the orbital cortex is similar in humans and primates and earlier discrepancies have been largely reconciled.8,9  

A recent detailed cyto-architectonic investigation of the human orbital and medial PFC (Figure 37.2b) revealed that all of the subdivisions recognized in the macaque have counterparts in humans.10 The rostro-caudally organized granular to agranular gradient seen in the rest of the frontal lobe also manifests itself in the orbitofrontal region: The posterior orbital cortex is dysgranular in contrast to the anterior granular areas.10 The lateral orbital cortex is recognized as BA 47/12. The rostral (anterior) orbital cortex is labeled as BA 11; it consists of a strongly granular cortex that is contiguous with the frontal pole (BA 10). Area 13 occupies the posterior medial orbital surface. Finally, area 14 embodies the cortex of the gyrus rectus at the ventromedial convexity of the frontal lobe. Thus, the OFR constitutes a region of cytoarchitectural transition between the agranular pririform olfactory cortex and the granular cortex of the dorsolateral PFC.11  

The medial wall of the prefrontal cortex comprises of agranular areas 24 (anterior cingulate cortex), 25 (most posterior/subgenual portion of the medial wall) and 32 (paracingulate cortex).10 These areas share some functions with portions of the OFR, but will not be discussed further in this chapter.  

#### Connectivity and functional considerations  

As described above, the primate orbitofrontal region occupies the entire ventral surface of the frontal lobe and is considered part of the prefrontal cortex.7 The granular prefrontal cortex (PFC) receives projections from the medio-dorsal nucleus of the thalamus and constitutes a large expanse of cortex situated in front of the motor and premotor regions of the frontal lobe (Brodmann areas 4 and 6).12 The PFC reaches its highest level of development in the human brain.13  

The PFC can be sub-categorized on the basis of divisions of the medio-dorsal nucleus of the thalamus,14,15 a critical relay structure, which in turn receives input from almost all other cortical areas:16  

(1) The medial part of the medio-dorsal nucleus (pars magnocellularis) projects to the orbital (ventral) surface of the PFC, the so-called ‘orbitofrontal cortex’ or orbitofrontal region (OFR). (2) The lateral part (pars parvocellularis) projects to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). This part of the PFC receives input from the parietal cortex and is involved in spatial short-term memory tasks.14,15

(3) The pars paralamellaris (the most lateral part of the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus) projects to the frontal eye fields (Brodmann area 6).  

In humans, indeed in all primates, the posterior part of the OFR is continuous with the rostral part of the agranular insula and abuts upon the para-olfactory component of the cingulate cortex, the anterior olfactory nucleus, and the piriform cortex. This part of the OFR is more primitive architectonically (nonisocortical OFR), and is hence regarded as more ‘limbic’ in character.17 On the other hand, the rostrally-placed isocortical OFR has the appearance of granular isocortex and blends into the dorsolateral heteromodal components of prefrontal cortex.17,18  

In addition to visceral information the OFR receives direct and indirect inputs from all sensory modalities (gustatory, olfactory, somatosensory, auditory and visual). Therefore, the OFR stands out as perhaps one of the most ‘polymodal’ brain regions.7 As a rule, cortico-cortical connections are densest among areas with comparable architecture: the more anterior isocortical OFR is mostly linked with isocortical prefrontal, premotor and sensory (somatic, auditory and visual) cortical areas. By contrast, the more posterior nonisocortical sectors of the OFR are mainly connected with nonisocortical areas of the insula and temporal lobe, and with primary olfactory and gustatory cortices.18

Figure 37.3 The three generally accepted surgical approaches to the OFR. These images show a brain abscess in the gyrus rectus, which could be approached by three possible directions: (1) Lateral approach: commonly performed when OFR resection is carried out after a period of extraoperative invasive recordings using subdural electrodes. (2) Anterior approach: used predominantly for lesionectomies in cases of smaller focal lesions. (3) Antero-lateral approach: may be used for larger lesions of the OFR and possibly combined with an orbito-zygomatic osteotomy. A principal advantage of the anterior and antero-lateral approaches is that the inferior frontal gyrus may be more easily spared.  

The posterior orbitofrontal cortex receives gustatory and olfactory input through direct connections that originate from the primary taste and olfactory cortices or indirectly via the thalamus. The afferent pathways through the thalamus to the orbitofrontal cortex are thought to mediate conscious perception and discrimination of odors. As a consequence, patients with lesions of the orbitofrontal cortex may lose the ability to discriminate odors.19  

The OFR has reciprocal connections with the amygdala both through the ventral amygdalofugal tract and through the stria terminalis,16 and projects back to the inferior temporal cortex, amygdala, as well as to the entorhinal cortex, which serves as ‘the gateway to the hippocampus’. In addition the OFR has projections to the hypothalamus and various brainstem structures (including the periaqueductal gray matter, and ventral tegmental area), the caudate nucleus and the cingulate cortex.18,20

Epileptologists should be familiar with the main bidirectional association pathways linking the OFR with the temporal lobe and limbic system: the uncinate fasciculus and the so-called ventral and dorsal limbic pathways:13  

The fibers of the uncinate fasciculus arise from the most rostral part of the superior temporal gyrus (T1). They run as part of the uncinate fasciculus and terminate in areas of the OFR and the medial PFC.   
The ventral limbic pathway originates from the parahippocampal gyrus (T5). It consists of two segments: The rostral segment runs through the uncinate fasciculus towards the OFR and medial PFC. The caudal segment terminates in areas of the dorsolateral PFC.   
The dorsal limbic pathway arises from the cingulate cortex and runs as part of the so-called cingulum bundle. Some components of these association fibers are directed towards the PFC (and terminate in the OFR, as well as medial and dorsolateral PFC).13  

In a recent stereo-EEG study Catenoix and co-workers investigated the functional anatomic connectivity between the hippocampus and OFR in humans by means of intracerebral hippocampal electrical stimulation21 in three patients. Low frequency $(\leq1\ \mathrm{Hz})$ bipolar stimulation of adjacent hippocampal contacts was found to result in reproducible evoked responses in the OFR with a mean, first peak latency of $222\mathrm{ms}$ , and confirmed the existence of functional connections between the hippocampus and the OFR in humans. The long latency of the main response indicates a polysynaptic projection from the hippocampus to the ipsilateral OFR, which, the authors speculate, may play a role in the interhemispheric propagation of discharges arising from mesial temporal structures. This hypothesis is supported by previous studies of ictal recordings obtained using bilateral mesial frontal and temporal depth electrodes, which show that the ipsilateral OFR is frequently and rapidly involved during propagation of seizures arising from the mesial temporal region.22 In a series of eight patients, who were studied with bilateral, multicontact, orbitofrontal depth electrodes, Wilson and Engel observed that 5mAmp stimulation of the OFR on one side was effective in evoking contralateral homotopic responses (responses recorded from the OFR on the other side) in the majority of cases.23 The authors recorded an initial, short-latency, ipsilateral OFR response in contacts adjacent to the stimulated electrodes, followed by a clear response of slightly longer latency in the contralateral OFR. The ease, with which the contralateral OFR response was elicited and recorded, has led to the hypothesis that spontaneous seizure activity may in fact use similar interhemispheric pathways to propagate contralaterally.23  

Lesions or damage to the OFR have been associated with significant changes in emotion, personality, behavior and social conduct. Patients often exhibit signs of disinhibition, impulsivity, inappropriate jocular affect (witzelsucht), emotional lability, poor judgment, lack of initiative and reduced concern for social conventions.24 It has been suggested that these patients may suffer from impaired detection of emotional reinforcers such as voice or face expression, and exhibit impaired responses to changing reinforcers.7 Indeed, the classical case of Phineas Gage, who was injured by a penetrating foreign object that lodged in both medial frontal lobes, may reflect the consequences of orbito-frontal region damage.25,26 Many signs evident in the early months after head injury to the basal frontal regions seem to fade away with the passage of time, suggesting plasticity involving othermbic regions or the contralateral homolog. The likelihood of residual personality changes is mainly determined by the severity of the injury.27 Autonomic and visceral changes including intermittent vasomotor instability and gastrointestinal or cardiac abnormalities may also occur following lesions of the OFR.28  

Functional imaging of the human OFR has generally confirmed its role in the assessment of potential reward and punishment as has previously been suggested by neurophysiological recordings in nonhuman primates. Additionally, a recent metaanalysis of 87 published functional imaging studies of the OFR suggests that there may be two trends of neural activity in the OFR. The first is a medio-lateral distinction, whereby the medial OFR activity is implicated in monitoring reward potential of different reinforcers – whereas lateral OFR activity is more related to the evaluation of punishers, which may lead to a change in ongoing behavior. The second is a posterior– anterior distinction in which complex or abstract reinforcers (such as monetary gain and loss) appear to be represented more anteriorly in the OFR compared to more simple (or visceral) reinforcers such as taste or pain.7  

It is evident that the OFR has extensive connections with medial temporal structures as well as thalamic regions involved in various stages of memory processing. Nonetheless, the functional role of the OFR in relationship to memory is not well understood.18 Dysfunction of the orbitofrontal cortex has been implicated in a number of psychiatric disorders. Neuroimaging studies have repeatedly implicated the OFR in the pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and depression. It has been consistently demonstrated that patients with OCD show increased uptake of tracers with SPECT and PET imaging measuring cerebral blood flow and metabolic activity.11,16 Interestingly, this hyperactivity of the orbitofrontal area has been found to normalize following successful pharmacological or behavioral therapy.29,30 On the other hand, hypometabolism of the OFR and adjacent brain regions has been observed in patients with secondary depression.31  

## Basal frontal lobe epilepsy  

It is difficult to estimate the prevalence of basal frontal epilepsy. The true percentage of patients in the general population, who have seizures originating from the basal frontal lobe, is unknown. The literature contains only a handful of patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy, whose seizures were clearly shown to arise from the orbitofrontal region.  

The most reliable evidence for accurate localization of the epileptogenic zone is seizure freedom after epilepsy surgery.32 This gold standard can only be applied to a small fraction of patients with focal epilepsy, namely patients with medically intractable seizures who are referred for surgical therapy and undergo successful surgical resections. One should remember, however, that a larger number of patients with basal frontal lobe epilepsy may not seek medical attention, may respond well to medications or may be misdiagnosed as having paroxysmal nonepileptic events.  

The epileptogenic zone is most precisely defined as the area of cortex generating seizures, the complete removal of which is necessary in order to abolish seizures.33 Therefore, under ideal circumstances the orbitofrontal origin of the epilepsy is deduced postoperatively on the basis of a surgical resection restricted to the OFR and leading to long-term cessation of seizures after surgery.  

When patients do not undergo resective surgery, or are not completely seizure free following resection, or in cases where surgical resection extends beyond the boundaries of the basal frontal lobe, the origin of seizures within the OFR is surmised by intracranial ictal EEG recordings and/or by the presence of a structural lesion. It should be emphasized, however, that these latter criteria (localized intracranial ictal recordings and/or presence of a demonstrable lesion) can not be used as surrogates to the concept of the epileptogenic zone.34  

Invasive recordings are currently required to demonstrate ictal onset within the OFR. In the subgroup of patients referred to tertiary epilepsy centers, estimates about the frequency of epilepsy arising from this region will depend on how frequently the OFR is investigated invasively.35 A large stereo-EEG study of 60 patients, who presented with electroclinical patterns requiring differentiation between frontal or temporal seizure onset and underwent exploration with at least one orbital frontal electrode, was reported by Munari and Bancaud in 1992. Ictal discharges were felt to be ‘primarily localized’ in the OFR in eight patients.36 The majority of patients in this highly selected group underwent ‘acute’ investigations lasting for less than 6 hours. Moreover, the authors did not comment on further surgical decisions, and extent of surgical resection and postsurgical outcome, when applicable. In a later review, Munari and co-workers concluded that their original stereo-EEG approach to the OFR ‘was not entirely satisfactory’, because it did not necessarily target the orbitofrontal cortex.37  

Jobst and co-workers presented a series of 26 patients with intractable frontal lobe epilepsy. Of these, seven patients were deemed to have seizures arising from the orbitofrontal region.38 All seven underwent tailored resections with excellent seizure outcome in five (mean follow-up was 52.2 months for the entire series). Individual results of scalp EEG, invasive recordings and brain MRIs were not listed. Similarly, the extent of surgical resection in each case was not provided. Given these limitations, patients from these two series are not included in our further discussions.  

The authors of one of the best-documented cases of orbitofrontal epilepsy39 set strict criteria to establish that seizures indeed arise from the OFR. These include: (1) the OFR should be the source of interictal and ictal activity, as defined by intracranial recordings; (2) resective surgery should be limited to the OFR, and (3) postoperatively the patient should remain free of seizures for at least 5 years. They also propose a fourth relative criterion: it would be preferable to include cases in which the resected surgical specimen from the orbitofrontal focus displayed specific histopathologic abnormalities.39  

Table 37.1 presents a compendium of cases of presumed orbitofrontal epilepsy as reported in the literature.37,39–53 An attempt has been made to include most, if not all, cases previously associated with the OFR (initial historical reports as well as more recent descriptions from the MRI era), and to retain the description of seizure semiology, results of neurophysiology, imaging and surgery, as provided in the original reports. Seizure outcome, when available, has been adapted according to the Wieser proposal for a new classification of outcome with

respect to seizures following epilepsy surgery.54 Careful review of these cases, with the above criteria in mind, reveals that in most instances localization of the epileptogenic zone within the OFR is either presumed or unconfirmed. Our inability to determine the extent of the epileptogenic zone and its relationship to the OFR, when surgical resection involves extra-orbital areas adjacent to the basal frontal lobe or when an extensive frontal lobectomy has been performed reflects a well-recognized inherent limitation of most human surgical studies.35  

### Seizure (clinical) semiology  

The most widely used system for classification of epilepsies was revised in 1989 by the Commission on Classification and Terminology of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE).55,56 The 1989 Proposal for the Classification of the Epilepsies and Epileptic syndromes describes a separate anatomically defined seizure pattern in regards to the orbitofrontal area: ‘The orbitofrontal seizure pattern is one of complex partial seizures with initial motor and gestural automatisms, olfactory hallucinations and illusions, and autonomic signs’.55  

The commission prefaces the 1989 report with a cautionary note: ‘... inferences regarding anatomical localization must be drawn carefully’. Attempts to classify seizures according to location (anatomic lobes or sublobar regions) are confounded by the fact that seizures usually give rise to ictal manifestations by virtue of propagation to eloquent areas of cortex. Large cortical areas in the anterior neocortex such as the prefrontal cortex may be clinically silent, when activated by seizure discharges or electrical stimulation. Consequently, the first clinical evidence of a seizure may reflect propagation to areas remote from the region of seizure origin.57 Seizures arising from a distinct focus within the frontal lobe may rapidly involve multiple frontal lobe regions concealing specific seizure patterns.58 On the other hand, extensive, nondiscrete, or multifocal epileptogenic zones and rapid spread patterns within the ipsilateral or contralateral frontal lobe will lead to overlapping, coincidental clinical phenomena. As a result of these limitations, attempts to classify frontal lobe seizures on the basis of distinct anatomic subdivisions may be restrictive and potentially misleading.35,59  

Moreover, only a handful of patients with unequivocal focal epilepsy arising from the orbitofrontal area have been reported in the literature, as is evident from the earlier discussion and the cases listed in Table 37.1. In their comprehensive review of ‘complex partial seizures of extratemporal lobe origin’ Swartz and Delgado-Escueta remarked that only eleven cases of ‘orbitofrontal complex partial seizures’ existed in the literature in a period spanning almost 20 years (from 1957–1975; all 11 cases are included in Table 37.1). And only nine of these were thought to carry ‘strong proof ’.60  

#### Electrical stimulation studies  

Direct electrical stimulation of the cortex has been used to study the results of epileptic activation of various cortical sites.61 Stimulation studies with an effective stimulus intensity reveal that the majority of human cortex is symptomatically silent, and provide further evidence to suggest that cortical activation by epileptiform discharges will not produce symptoms, unless the electrical activity spreads to adjacent eloquent cortical sites.34  

Stimulation of the OFR has been reported to produce a variety of responses. Smith and co-workers report that stimulation of the lateral and mesial posterior OFR (including the apparent ictal onset zone in a patient with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy) did not produce any observable clinical phenomena. Such findings lend support to the hypothesis that clinical manifestations of basal frontal epilepsies may in fact begin outside the basal frontal area.51 The same group stimulated 13 posterior orbitofrontal sites using laterally placed depth electrodes in nine patients, who did not have evidence of focal epilepsy arising from the OFR. An assortment of sensations were elicited in this group including ‘body tingling’ on six occasions, and ‘a spacedout, confused feeling’ on four; ‘an unpleasant feeling’, an illdefined smell, an olfactory hallucination, a cephalic sensation, lightheadedness, and ‘fuzzy vision’ were reported on one occasion each.51 In their series of orbitofrontal stereo-EEG depth electrode investigations Munari and Bancaud report that an olfactory hallucination can be elicited in the presence or absence of ‘a localized afterdischarge’ following posterior orbitofrontal stimulation.36 Smith and co-workers postulate that such provoked olfactory symptoms may actually reflect activation of the adjacent lateral olfactory striae,51 which is possible, given that afterdischarges related to electrical stimulation often activate a more extensive cortical region beyond the cerebral tissue surrounding the directly stimulated electrode.61  

Lastly, autonomic responses resulting from OFR stimulation in humans were reported in older studies;62,63 these include blood pressure elevation or bradycardia,64 respiratory arrest or increased amplitude of respiration, and increased esophageal contractions or decreased gastrointestinal motility.  

#### Ictal manifestations  

As discussed earlier, the large prefrontal cortical region can be viewed as a collection of heteromodal association areas, which share elaborate connections with other frontal and extrafrontal cortical and subcortical structures.65 Hence, seizures arising from several regions within the anterior part of the frontal lobe – including the orbitofrontal, frontopolar, anterior cingulate, and medial intermediate frontal regions – may display overlapping clinical characteristics as a result of the rapid and simultaneous activation of cortical sites within the PFC and its connections.58,66 In general, seizures arising from the frontal lobe may start and end abruptly with little if any postictal confusion, and tend to have a shorter duration (lasting less than 30 seconds) and higher frequency (oftentimes occurring in clusters) compared to seizures of temporal lobe origin.35 Ictal behavior is commonly characterized by prominent and often complex motor manifestations. Because of their bizarre appearance at times, frontal lobe seizures are not infrequently mistaken for nonepileptic, psychogenic events.67 The somewhat circuitous and dichotomous term ‘frontal lobe complex partial seizures’ has been proposed by some authors to describe these events.53,68,69 Stereotypic recurrence of the various clinical components in individual patients is key in establishing the correct diagnosis of seizures arising from the frontal lobe.53,67  

Again, it is important to recognize that the observed seizure semiology reflects epileptic activation of the symptomatogenic zone.34 When seizures originate from silent areas of the brain there will be no outward manifestations without propagation of seizure activity to the symptomatogenic zone. Studies with depth electrodes have shown that ictal onset within the OFR may precede the onset of clinical manifestations by as much as 60 seconds suggesting asymptomatic activation of this area.37,51,70 Two separate groups of investigators have observed that patients may in fact remain completely asymptomatic, when the epileptic discharge stays localized within the OFR.37,47 Summarizing their experience of more than 150 patients, in whom the orbitofrontal region was investigated using stereoEEG, Munari and co-workers concluded that ‘the only clinical from characteristic of well-limited discharges in the orbital cortex was the absence of any objective clinical symptomatology’.71  

Based on these observations, the limited number of welldocumented published cases, and the functional heterogeneity of the OFR, it is difficult to assume a unique seizure semiology that is characteristic for this part of the frontal lobe. A review of reported cases reveals some common themes: lack of aura or nonspecific auras, autonomic changes, behavioral arrest and/or impaired awareness, complex motor and ‘hypermotor’ activity, vocalization, oculocephalic deviation, olfactory or gustatory hallucinations, occasional secondary generalization.55,66,72 Occurrence in clusters, nocturnal preponderance, relatively brief duration and brief if any postictal confusion are also observed.  

Based on the cases reported by Ludwig41 (see Table 37.1) Bancaud and Talairach identified two ‘recognizable seizure patterns’ associated with seizures of orbitofrontal origin,73 as follows:  

(1) Olfactory auras, defined as seizures beginning with an olfactory hallucination or illusion. The olfactory symptoms may be accompanied by gustatory auras, autonomic changes, oroalimentary and/or gestural automatisms and ‘thymic alterations’. These associated symptoms have been attributed to propagation of ictal discharges to the adjacent opercular-insular-amygdalar region (autonomic manifestations, gustatory hallucinations or illusions, and oroalimentary activity) and/or to anterior cingulate region (complex gestural activity ‘automatic gesticulations’, and mood changes).36 Other studies have shown that olfactory auras usually point to seizures originating from the limbic mesial temporal structures, which are also involved in olfactory function.74,75 In fact, published reports suggest that olfactory auras constitute an uncommon manifestation of seizures arising from the basal frontal region.76  

(2) Autonomic seizures, defined as seizures of prevalent ‘vegetative components’. They present with a variety of paroxysmal autonomic disorders including cardiovascular (heart rate changes, facial flushing, pallor), respiratory (apnea), digestive (sensation of hunger and/or thirst), urogenital (urge to urinate and periictal urination) and thermoregulatory disturbances (sensation of cold with piloerection and/or sensation of heat). Ictal ‘vegetative’ manifestations are thought to result from activation of the orbitofrontal and opercular insular regions.35,73  

The so-called ‘hypermotor seizures’ constitute another ictal pattern commonly associated with this region. According to the Semiologic Seizure Classification hypermotor, seizures are defined as seizures manifesting with complex motor automatisms – organized motor activity, which primarily affects the proximal body segments and results in relatively large amplitude movements.77 The term ‘organized’ refers to movements that imitate natural movements as opposed to dystonic, tonic or clonic movements, but does not specify whether they are voluntary, involuntary or semipurposeful (e.g., evoked in response to environmental stimuli).78 When rapidly executed these movements may appear violent, for example thrashing, bicycling, vigorous kicking, frenetic striking or flailing of limbs and other rather peculiar motor behaviors.76 The repetitive character of these motions has been attributed to the central role of the prefrontal and premotor areas of the frontal lobe in the sequential design of movements.79  

In a large series of suspected frontal or temporal lobe epilepsies Manford and co-workers identified 13 patients with a CT and/or MRI-demonstrable lesion (‘lesional focal epilepsy’) and hypermotor seizures, characterized by early ‘motor agitation’. The authors noted that the structural lesions involved the OFR in the majority of cases (7 out of 13). Lesions extended to the frontopolar cortex in Six of these Seven patients.80 The remaining Six cases with early motor agitation showed no consistent lesion localization (their lesions resided in various other frontal or temporal areas). Such observations may support the 1989 ILAE classification of anatomically defined seizure types of possible orbitofrontal origin. It should be noted however, that this was not a series of patients undergoing resective epilepsy surgery, and that the definition of the presumed epileptogenic focus was based on somewhat loose and often discordant clinical, EEG and MRI/CT localization criteria. In his review of structural lesions in the frontal lobe Goldensohn found ‘… too few cases with discrete lesions with sufficiently detailed seizure descriptions of possible orbitofrontal and cingulate origin to allow separate categorizations’.66 The author concluded that symptoms and signs commonly linked to orbitofrontal and/or cingulate epilepsy (such as autonomic or mood and affect changes, gestural automatisms, and versive movements preceding automatisms) do not appear to differentiate between lesion cases involving the orbitofrontal, anterior cingulate or other areas of the anterior third of the frontal lobe.66  

Finally, it should be emphasized that epileptogenic foci within the OFR can give rise to seizures, which are electroclinically indistinguishable from temporal lobe seizures given the widespread connections between the limbic system and the OFR.39,47,50 In other words, basal frontal epilepsy may manifest itself with seizure spread outside the lobe of origin, as illustrated by Shihabuddin and colleagues in their case of a small right orbitofrontal pilocytic astrocytoma. Invasive recordings demonstrated seizure generation in the right OFR with spread to the ipsilateral mesial-basal temporal region – seizures were eliminated almost completely following right mesial orbitofrontal lesionectomy.50  

### Electroencephalography  

#### Surface EEG  

The ability of the scalp EEG to detect interictal activity depends on the extent of the irritative zone, the location and proximity of the generator in relation to the scalp and the orientation of the dipole.81 In general, interictal or ictal surface EEG studies are not very helpful in identifying epileptogenic foci residing in the basal frontal lobe because of the hidden, distant location of this part of the cortex with relation to scalp electrodes. Even long-term sleep-deprived interictal EEG recordings may be completely normal despite activation procedures. This apparent lack of interictal and/or ictal EEG abnormalities is a well-known weakness of electroencephalography.74  

When detected on scalp EEG, interictal epileptiform discharges are helpful in establishing the diagnosis of epilepsy. Prolonged daytime EEG studies with recordings of 1–2 hours of sleep, as well as nocturnal sleep recordings increase the yield of interictal epileptiform abnormalities in individuals with epilepsy.82–84 Increased sampling using special electrodes (such as sphenoidal, anterior temporal or ear electrodes)85,86 and closely spaced additional scalp electrodes87–89 may be helpful in distinguishing temporal from frontal lobe foci.  

Home videotape recordings, when available, can provide valuable diagnostic information by capturing ictal manifestations. Prolonged inpatient video-EEG monitoring is indicated in patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy as well as patients with paroxysmal events of unclear etiology. Careful video analysis of ictal semiology may lend support to the diagnosis of frontal lobe epilepsy, even in some cases where EEG is inconclusive. Polysomnographic recordings with additional EEG montages should be considered, in cases of predominantly nocturnal paroxysmal phenomena.90,91  

Typically, abnormalities that are detectable on scalp EEG do not allow for topographic localization of foci residing in the basal frontal lobe. When present, spikes or sharp waves may have a regional distribution or appear generalized as a result of secondary bilateral synchrony.87 False localization to the anterior temporal region is not uncommon in patients with basal frontal epilepsies, who present with anterior temporal interictal epileptiform discharges (Figure 37.6) on their scalp EEG.57 Occasionally, propagated epileptiform activity can be present over central or frontolateral regions.76 Moreover, epileptiform abnormalities may have a misleadingly widespread appearance, because of the large distance and intervening cortical area that separates the epileptogenic zone from the scalp EEG electrodes.81,92 Interictal sharp waves may be reflected over a wide bifrontal region as a result of volume conduction (Figure 37.7) such bilateral discharges may sometimes exhibit a shifting right or left preponderance or a misleading contralateral maximum.35 The inaccessibility of the basal frontal surface and other areas of the frontal lobe to scalp electrodes, the widespread connectivity of the OFR, the variable size and location of epileptogenic foci within this region and the potential for bilateral epileptogenicity as a result of bifrontal injuries are among the factors accounting for the lack of adequate topographic scalp EEG localization in basal frontal lobe epilepsies.33  

Large and somewhat blunted sharp waves were demonstrated by Tharp in his patients with presumed orbitofrontal epilepsy.52 Case reports by Ludwig and co-workers highlighted the occurrence of bilaterally synchronous, paroxysmal epileptiform discharges, with a bifrontal or frontopolar maximum, as well as discharges involving one anterior quadrant, with or without evidence of additional temporal lobe involvement.41 In the single patient described by Chang and colleagues sphenoidal recordings exhibited a consistent preponderance on the side of the epileptogenic OFR. In this well-documented case report the addition of sphenoidal and infraorbital scalp electrodes revealed that the observed bisynchronous discharges had a more basal distribution with a maximum in the infraorbital regions.39  

The close anatomical connections between the mesial temporal and orbitofrontal regions have already been discussed. In their classic (1958) paper, Kendrick and Gibbs used the technique of strychnine neuronography in the course of temporal lobectomies to demonstrate the bidirectional interrelationship between these two regions in humans.93 Local application of strychnine through needle electrodes produced ‘artificial’ spike foci in the frontal and temporal lobes of 34 patients. The authors observed that strychnine-induced spikes in the mesial temporal region commonly spread to the mesial orbital surface of the ipsilateral frontal lobe as well as to the tip of the ipsilateral temporal lobe. On the other hand, strychnine injected into the mesial OFR resulted in spike discharges that propagated first to the ipsilateral mesial temporal cortex, and later to the contralateral mesial OFR and to a lesser extent to the frontal poles. The authors concluded that discharges may spread in either direction – depending upon whether strychnine is first applied in the mesial temporal or orbitofrontal area – and implicated the ‘pathway afforded by the uncinate fasciculus’ to explain the observed spread patterns.

Figure 37.7 Interictal scalp EEG tracing. Less frequently, generalized epileptiform discharges (with a shifting bifrontal maximum; higher on the right side in this instance) were seen during prolonged video-EEG recordings, as illustrated on this routine longitudinal bipolar montage.  

Ictal scalp EEG recordings (Figure 37.8) during seizures of frontal lobe origin, as a whole, may provide poorly localizing94,95 or misleading information.96 Seizure duration is usually short and muscle artifact often obscures ictal EEG activity. Furthermore, observed patterns and frequency of activity at the time of electroencephalographic seizure onset do not correlate with the cortical area generating seizures.97 When ictal EEG is inconclusive or normal, diagnosis will rely on the history and ictal semiology. In cases where the clinical pattern does not provide additional clues with respect to lateralization to one hemisphere, detailed analysis of clinical seizure onset may be helpful in disclosing a clearly defined focal symptomatology.98  

The localizing value of ictal scalp EEG is generally inferior in extra-temporal epilepsies.33,99 Using lateralized rhythmic discharges, postictal slowing and EEG activity at seizure onset only $47-65\%$ of extratemporal seizures are correctly lateralized, as opposed to $76\mathrm{-}83\%$ of temporal lobe seizures.99 Surface ictal EEG recordings were retrospectively analyzed in a recent series of 46 patients with neocortical focal epilepsy, who became seizure free after surgical resection of a single lobe (lateral frontal $_{=15}$ , mesial frontal $^{=8}$ , neocortical tempo$\mathrm{\ral{=}}10$ , parietal $^{=7}$ and occipital $=6$ ). In this series, virtually all seizures that were either obscured by artifact or had no identifiable EEG change had a frontal lobe origin.33 Localized EEG patterns were more common with seizures arising from the dorsolateral frontal region.  

#### Intracranial EEG  

Patients with suspected pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy should be referred to a comprehensive epilepsy center for a thorough presurgical evaluation, which includes prolonged video-EEG recordings, high-resolution structural and functional imaging and neuropsychological assessment. When results of presurgical studies are inconclusive or incongruent and epilepsy surgery is being considered, invasive EEG recordings with subdural grid and/or depth electrodes may be necessary to delineate the epileptic focus.  

Invasive approaches to verify the location of the epileptogenic focus include: intraoperative electrocorticography, extraoperative invasive electrode recordings (using extradural, subdural and/or intracerebral electrodes), and stereo-electroencephalography.60 It is important to emphasize that invasive electrodes record from limited parts of the cortex only, and do not provide the global picture of brain activity afforded by scalp electrodes.100,101 Hence, intracranial electrode monitoring should only be utilized, once a reasonable hypothesis about the possible location(s) of the epileptogenic zone has been made based on the results of a detailed presurgical evaluation.102 When epileptogenicity involving the basal frontal lobe is suspected, electrode coverage of both the frontal and the temporal lobe may be necessary, to better localize the epileptogenic zone and differentiate between frontal and temporal involvement (Figures 37.9 and 37.10). Furthermore, use of bilateral frontal electrodes may be contemplated as a means of improving the investigators’ ability to study lateralization and mode of propagation of ictal discharges.103

Figure 37.8 Ictal scalp EEG tracings on a routine longitudinal bipolar montage during a typical nocturnal seizure: (a) The electrographic onset (EEG onset) is punctuated by the appearance during sleep of an initial low voltage semi-rhythmic activity, which gradually evolves into more rhythmic and sharply contoured delta slowing over the left hemisphere; (b) 20 seconds later repetitive spikes within the ill-defined slowing.  

Stereotactically placed depth electrodes are useful in accurately targeting/evaluating deep structures, but sample only a restricted area. On the other hand, subdural electrodes provide better spatial resolution and can sample a larger expanse of cortex as they record directly from the cortical surface that underlies the pia matter. However, only about one-third of the cortex is exposed, and generators located within the depth of a sulcus cannot be sampled adequately unless they extend to the cortical surface or crown.104 Subdural grid or strip electrode arrays are inserted under general anesthesia following craniotomy and incision of the dura. Such arrays are usually slid under the edges of the exposed dura, in contact with the brain surface, without direct visualization for the purposes of recording from the orbitofrontal and adjacent inferior temporal areas.105 The current approach at both the Cleveland Clinic Epilepsy Center and at the Texas Comprehensive Epilepsy Program is to sample the basal frontal region using a $4\times4$ subdural electrode array (Figure 37.9); made of four rows and four columns of platinum-iridium disk electrodes, each of which has a $4\mathrm{mm}$ diameter and is separated from neighboring electrodes by a center-to-center distance of 1cm.106

As described above, the OFR has widespread connections with the anterior and mesial temporal regions, the insula, opercular areas and cingulate gyrus. Adequate sampling of these areas is recommended during invasive recordings in patients with suspected basal frontal epilepsies.107,108 Good communication between the neurosurgeon and the epileptologist/neurophysiologist involved in the clinical management and interpretation of presurgical studies is essential during the planning stage. In addition, functional mapping by means of electrical cortical stimulation may be necessary to identify eloquent cortex such as language areas and motor cortex.

Roper and Gilmore used a single subdural strip electrode to sample the orbitofrontal cortex in all cases of limbic epilepsy referred for invasive monitoring during a period of 1 year.46 A total of 15 patients underwent invasive evaluations during this period (unilateral investigations with temporal, frontal, and orbitofrontal subdural electrodes were performed in eight and bilateral studies using bitemporal depth electrodes along with bilateral inferolateral temporal and orbitofrontal subdural electrodes were performed in seven patients). Three patients out of the 15 patients with intractable limbic seizures were found to have seizures originating from within the OFR (see Table 37.1). Subdural strip electrodes identified the OFR as the site of seizure origin (ictal onset zone), but were insufficient to define the actual boundaries of the epileptogenic zone. To better delineate the boundaries of the epileptogenic area the authors supplemented their investigations with the use of intraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG). These investigations and subsequent surgical excisions led the authors to conclude that unilateral OFR resections can be beneficial in a subset of patients with orbitofrontal epilepsy and can be performed without significant neuropsychologic impairment.  

Stereo-electro-encephalography (stereo-EEG, sEEG) refers to the methodology of stereotactically-guided depth electrode recordings, which was originally developed by Bancaud and Talairach in France. Ictal anatomo-electro-clinical correlations based on sEEG recordings are utilized in identifying the cortical area(s) primarily involved in the generation of spontaneous ictal discharges, and provide a guide to tailored cortical resection.109 For the school of stereo-EEG investigations individualized planning of electrode implantation is critical. The surgical team is assigned with the task of finding the best compromise between the ‘ideal’ position of the electrode and the constraints introduced by the various vascular segments, which the electrode may encounter along the length of its trajectory from the surface to the deeper brain targets.103,110  

In their review of the electroclinical features of orbitofrontal seizures Munari and Bancaud summarized their experience in a series of 60 patients, who underwent stereo-EEG investigations with at least one orbitofrontal depth electrode. The majority of these stereotactically implanted multilead electrodes (total of 10 contacts, each $2\mathrm{mm}$ in size and $1.5\mathrm{mm}$ apart) were inserted via an orthogonal, lateral approach and aimed to explore both the medial and lateral aspects of the OFR.36 An oblique approach was used in a few cases and a vertical approach was utilized in a single patient.  

Spread between OFR and temporal lobe may occur extremely rapidly via the uncinate fasciculus as documented by stereo-EEG investigations of spontaneous seizures arising from the basal frontal lobe.36 Other investigators have observed that ‘orbitofrontal seizures’ propagate more slowly compared to seizures arising from other extratemporal locations.101 This observation comes out of a fairly small study of 10 patients with extratemporal neocortical epilepsy. A total of 25 seizures were studied with intracranial recordings using a combination of subdural strips, subdural grids, and depth electrodes implanted ‘as clinically indicated’. Two patients in this group were thought to have seizures arising from the OFR and both underwent bilateral intracranial EEG investigations. A total of eight ‘orbitofrontal seizures’ were studied, although details on individual seizures were not provided. The authors defined the ipsilateral and contralateral propagation time as the time elapsed from electrographic seizure onset to first spread either to an adjacent ipsilateral lobe or to the contralateral hemisphere. For ‘orbitofrontal seizures’ spread to the ipsilateral temporal lobe occurred within a period ranging from 12.5 to 85 seconds, and to the contralateral frontal lobe within a period ranging from 9.8 to 92 seconds (compared to a more rapid ipsilateral or contralateral spread, as early as within 0 to 0.4 seconds, in some seizures arising from other frontal or parieto-occipital locations).101 The small patient number and the potential spatial sampling limitations of invasive recordings need to be taken into account, when interpreting these results.  

### Structural and functional imaging  

#### Structural imaging  

High resolution anatomical MRI should be performed to search for focal intracerebral lesions, and ideally interpreted by expert radiologists, experienced in imaging of the epilepsies.111 Identification of a structural abnormality by MRI adds substantially to the process of localizing the site of seizure onset and selecting favorable candidates for resective epilepsy surgery.112 Structural abnormalities may be found in up to $80\%$ of patients with refractory focal epilepsy using optimal anatomical MRI imaging.113  

Structural MRI can provide reliable information about the pathology of the suspected epileptogenic lesion. Common MRI-identifiable pathologies include disorders of cortical development and foreign-tissue lesions (such as tumors and vascular malformations). Furthermore, findings on MRI help tailor the surgical procedure and assess the extent of resection postoperatively.112 A particular challenge for T2 weighted MRI sequences investigating the human OFR using is the potential for susceptibility artifacts resulting in signal dropout or geometric distortion as a result of the close proximity of the OFR to the air-filled sinuses.7

Figure 37.10 Ictal invasive EEG recordings on a referential montage displaying the electrode contacts on the C (orbitofrontal) and D (lateral temporal) plates: The electrographic onset is punctuated by the appearance of focal repetitive spiking involving the mesial, posterior corner of the orbitofrontal plate (electrodes C1 followed by electrodes C2 and C5). This activity remains confined to the orbitofrontal area without evidence of concurrent involvement of other electrodes for several (\~25) seconds.  

When MRI is negative but EEG or other testing points to a potential area of focal epileptogenicity, dedicated MRI sequences114 with thin cuts through the region(s) of interest should be obtained. Imaging with higher magnetic fields or three-dimensional MRI techniques may further increase the yield and allow for presurgical identification of epileptogenic lesions.115 As illustrated in the case reported by Rugg-Gunn and colleagues48 the use of diffusion tensor imaging and advanced postacquisition processing analyses can enhance the detection rate of subtle abnormalities in patients with so-called ‘nonlesional’ focal epilepsies.116,117  

Functional imaging  

Functional imaging with interictal PET and/or ictal SPECT studies may be employed as a means of identifying seizure foci in the basal frontal lobe and guiding surgical resection.  

Interictal studies of brain metabolism using 18FDG-PET (fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography) may disclose areas of hypometabolism in up to $60\%$ of patients with frontal lobe epilepsy. However, almost $90\%$ of these patients will have an underlying MRI-identifiable structural abnormality.118 In neocortical epilepsy it is often difficult to interpret small or subtle focal areas of hypometabolism of questionable clinical relevance in the absence of a structural lesion.119 Consequently, 18FDG-PET studies may be of limited value in nonlesional frontal lobe epilepsies.  

Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has been used in patients with focal epilepsy to assess alterations of cerebral perfusion that may reflect the approximate location of the epileptic focus. Ictal SPECT is the only available, noninvasive modality practically suited for functional brain imaging during an actual seizure.119 Digital subtraction techniques allow for comparison of an individual patient’s interictal (baseline) and ictal SPECT images. The relatively low-resolution subtraction images afforded by SPECT can then be coregistered to the patient’s anatomical MRI for more precise localization.119 This computer-aided process was found to be diagnostically superior, when compared to routine side-by-side visual inspection of ictal and interictal SPECT scans.120 Recent studies suggest that subtraction SPECT images are useful in guiding the location and extent of surgical resection in patients with extratemporal epilepsy.121 There have been no specific reports related to subtraction/ictal SPECT imaging in patients with seizures arising from the basal frontal lobe. Because of their sometimes brief duration and propensity of frontal lobe seizures for rapid secondary generalization it may particularly difficult to obtain and interpret ictal SPECT studies.  

In contrast to the aforementioned nuclear imaging techniques, magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a neurophysiological method with high temporal and spatial resolution. Results of MEG source localization can be co-registered to structural MRI data and produce the so-called magnetic source imaging (MSI), which is currently explored as a means of improving noninvasive localization of epileptogenic foci. The conjugation of noninvasive neurophysiology and anatomical neuroimaging using MEG/EEG along with MRI can provide important insights into the generation and spatiotemporal evolution of neocortical discharges. However, the results obtained require careful clinical analysis, integration and comparison with available preoperative testing and further validation. $^{122}\mathrm{\MSI^{123}}$ along with ictal SPECT studies124 may play an increasingly important role in directing placement of electrodes in patients with suspected frontal lobe epilepsy, being considered for resective surgery.125 At this time, however, the role of MSI in the presurgical evaluation of patients with suspected basal frontal lobe epilepsies remains unclear.  

## Etiologies of basal frontal lobe epilepsy  

Out of the 23 cases assembled in Table 37.1, a brain abscess was identified in two patients, and a tumor in another two (one had a pilocytic astrocytoma; the tumor type was unknown in the second case). Two more patients were found to have cortical dysplasia, while four patients were suspected to have a posttraumatic etiology. Histo-pathological examination showed nonspecific ‘gliosis’ in five patients and no abnormalities in three. Details on histopathology of resected tissue were not provided/not known in the remaining five cases.  

The OFR is a common site for closed-head injury. Nonpenetrating head traumas may produce forces that move the basal frontal brain parenchyma across the underlying uneven surface of the orbital roof.126 Falls or blows on the front of the head produce direct frontal lobe damage, while trauma to the occipital region produce basal frontal and fronto-polar injury by a contre-coup mechanism. Hence, posttraumatic epilepsy following closed head injury often involves the frontal and/or temporal lobes. The diffuse nature of nonpenetrating head injuries often limits localization of the epileptogenic focus, especially in patients without distinct, MRI-identifiable focal lesions.127 It should also be noted that extensive cortical abrasions and/or lacerations in the orbitofrontal region may not be easily detected by CT and/or MRI because of the relatively limited three-dimensional volume of these lesions and the artifacts introduced by the surrounding bony irregularities of the cribriform plate.128  

The prognosis and risk of later epilepsy depends on the severity of the trauma and concomitant cerebral complications.129,130 Post-traumatic epilepsy refers to the recurrent, unprovoked seizures developing more than one week after penetrating or closed head injury.131 Nearly $40\%$ of seizures appear within the first 6 months, and $70\mathrm{-}80\%$ by the first 2 years after the injury.132 The risk of posttraumatic epilepsy falls rapidly as the post-injury seizure-free interval increases, but does persist for more than 15 years after the injury, especially in cases of moderate to severe trauma.130  

The olfactory nerves are located immediately below the OFR and are similarly susceptible to injury following closed head trauma. Post-traumatic anosmia usually results from shearing of the olfactory nerve fascicles as they traverse the cribriform plate to enter the olfactory bulb.133 Because of this shared mechanism of injury posttraumatic anosmia may serve as an important clinical sign of concomitant orbitofrontal damage. Significant hypoperfusion in the OFR has been demonstrated with the use of HMPAO-SPECT in a series of 18 patients, who had been rendered completely anosmic as a result of a remote head injury.134 In a similar study of 11 anosmic patients with a history of prior head injury quantitative PET studies showed evidence of hypometabolism in the OFR as well as in the medial temporal region compared with controls.135  

In a similar series of 20 head-injury patients the finding of marked post-traumatic anosmia was taken as a strong indication of damage to the OFR.128 Most of these patients appeared intact on psychometric neuropsychological testing and were generally preserved in areas such as intelligence, memory and language. Nevertheless, they faced major psychosocial difficulties; most of them were unemployed and showed evidence of poor empathy, poor judgment and absent-mindedness. It is not uncommon for patients with OFR injuries to perform normally on a variety of standard neuropsychological tests.128,136 More specialized testing is required to expose deficits related to decision making and executive planning. The authors concluded that posttraumatic anosmia has a close and specific relationship with a particular locus of injury (OFR) and a specific set of neurobehavioral symptoms that constitute the so-called ‘orbitofrontal syndrome’.  

Another common insult with predominant temporal and/or orbitofrontal localization that deserves mentioning in this section is herpes simplex encephalitis. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is the cause of the most common sporadic viral encephalitis in adults and children older than 6 months.137 Encephalitis due to HSV infection (both primary and recurrent infection) is a serious disease with an untreated mortality approaching $70\%$ and substantial morbidity despite antiviral therapy.138 Pathological studies of HSV encephalitis have shown predominant viral-related damage in limbic structures as well as neighboring areas including the mesial temporal lobe (hippocampal formation, amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, and perirhinal cortex), orbitofrontal region, insula and cingulate gyrus.139 The selective and often remarkably segregated involvement of temporal and orbitofrontal locations may in part reflect the route of entry of the virus into the host. In primary infection HSV may gain access to the brain via an olfactory route reaching the olfactory bulbs through the cribriform and subsequently spreading along the base of the frontal lobe. In reactivation of latent HSV infection the virus may spread from the trigeminal ganglion along meningeal branches of the trigeminal nerve.137,140  

The long-term sequelae of rigorously confirmed HSV encephalitis in the era of antiviral therapy (with acyclovir) were investigated in a retrospective study from New Zealand, in which a total of 42 acyclovir-treated patients were followed for a period of up to 11 years.141 The mortality rate was $12\%$ at 1 month and $14\%$ at 6 months. All but one of the surviving patients had persistent neurological impairment. The most common and most disabling complication was that of memory dysfunction (especially short-term memory). Personality and behavioral disorders occurred in almost half of the long-term survivors, albeit less severe compared to reported disability before the introduction of acyclovir. Epilepsy was present in $24\%$ of surviving patients. Of note, two-thirds of survivors were found to have unilateral or bilateral anosmia, although may of these patients were unaware of the deficit.141  

Other common substrates of extratemporal focal epilepsy include tumors, vascular anomalies and developmental disorders. The importance of MRI-identifiable lesions involving the deeply situated orbitofrontal region should not be underestimated. Studies of anatomically defined lesions in various locations of the brain cortex indicate that these lesions will more often than not harbor the site of the epileptogenic focus.142 In this case complete excision of the lesion along with the surrounding ‘epileptogenic tissue’ provides an excellent chance for a seizure-free outcome.38,66 Studies have shown that one of the best prognostic factors in epilepsy surgery is in fact the completeness of such lesionectomies.143 Poor surgical results are more common in cases, where postoperative MRI provides evidence of incomplete resection of the lesional pathology.144  

With improvements in neuroimaging, cortical dysplasias and other developmental disorders are increasingly recognized as causes of pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy. It is estimated that nearly $30\%$ of surgical specimens from patients with neocortical epilepsy contain some type of malformation of cortical development.145 In fact, dysplastic lesions (ranging from heterotopias to subtle cytoarchitectural abnormalities) are the most common histopathological finding in some surgical series of frontal lobe epilepsies.38  

Among the various vascular anomalies, cavernous angiomas (cavernous malformations, CM) and arteriovenous malformations (AVM), are more likely to cause seizures. The epileptogenicity of these lesions is believed to result from pathological changes imparted on tissue surrounding the vascular malformation due to ongoing microhemorrhage and hemosiderin deposition.146 Therefore, surgical excision should not only target the lesion but extend to the adjacent hemosiderin-stained tissue.147  

Frequently encountered tumoral pathologies associated with pharmacoresistant epilepsy include gangliogliomas, dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNETs) and lowgrade gliomas. In cases involving the basal frontal lobe, a gross total resection to clear margins provides the best chance for control from both the oncology and epilepsy standpoint.148  

Gliosis as a result of previous anoxia, head trauma, or other unknown causes may be the only identifiable in pathology in surgical specimens obtained from patients with focal epilepsy. Lastly, a curious clinicopathologic entity of intracranial choristomas involving the gyrus rectus has been reported recently in two adult patients with seizures. In both cases the epileptogenic lesions were composed of heterotopic epithelial, glial and mesenchymal components. The histogenesis of these lesions is unclear, but the preferential involvement of the gyrus rectus, which is in close proximity to the frontal bone, led the authors to speculate a common origin from neural crest progenitors.149  

### Medical therapy  

Seizures arising from the basal frontal region may respond to standard anticonvulsant agents (AEDs). As the seizures are focal in origin carbamazepine (or phenytoin) has been recommended as first line of treatment.150 Alternatively monotherapy with a newer AED such as lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, topiramate or gabapentin could be considered based on drugdrug interactions and side-effect profile.151 If patients do not respond to monotherapy trials at maximum tolerated doses a second agent may be added. Valproic acid may have a role in preventing secondarily generalized seizures. Other adjunctive agents include levetiracetam, zonisamide and tiagabine.152 Approximately $65\%$ of patients with focal epilepsy respond to appropriate anticonvulsant therapy.153,154 When medical therapy provides inadequate control of seizures or unacceptable side effects, the possibility of resective surgery should be explored. Patients with evidence of pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy should be referred to a specialized epilepsy center for presurgical evaluation and management. Patients who are not favorable surgical candidates or have failed surgical resection may be considered for implantation of a vagus nerve stimulator (VNS). Unfortunately, it has not been possible to predict which patients will benefit from chronic VNS before implanting the device.155  

### Surgical approaches to the OFR  

The surgical anatomy of and surgical approaches to the orbitofrontal region have not been well characterized in the published literature. One possible reason for this may be the fact that prior to the widespread application of invasive electrophysiology in surgical epilepsy programs the OFR has generally not been viewed as a target for resection. While portions of the basal frontal lobe are routinely retracted during neurosurgical procedures for vascular or neoplastic abnormalities, resections of the OFR itself are uncommon. A notable exception is the resection of the gyrus rectus that is carried out to facilitate exposure during pterional/subfrontal approaches to aneurysms involving the anterior communicating artery and proximal A2 segment of the anterior cerebral artery. The epilepsy surgeon accessing the OFR should, therefore, familiarize him/herself with the anatomy of the region and discuss the goals of the planned procedure with the treating epileptologist.  

#### Invasive monitoring of the OFR  

The investigation of nonlesional basal frontal lobe epilepsy is challenging, yet necessary, given the ‘buried’ nature of the cortex in this region. We prefer the use of subdural electrodes to depth electrodes to investigate the OFR. If a fronto-temporal craniotomy is planned, it is extended anteriorly to expose most of the frontal operculum; if burr holes and strip electrodes are planned, one burr hole is placed over the pterion (‘the keyhole’). In the case of a craniotomy, a $4{\times}4$ electrode array, with its lead situated laterally, is placed over the orbital roof, to cover a significant portion of the OFR. If burr holes are used, a 4-contact strip electrode is placed over the posterior portion of the OFR.  

#### Resections of the OFR  

The surgical approach to the OFR is dictated by the surgeon’s familiarity with a particular approach, the pathologic process being treated (lesion resection versus regional OFR excision for intractable epilepsy), the location of the lesion, and whether or not the resection involves the (presumed or apparent) dominant hemisphere. Another important consideration during surgical planning should be the connections of this region with the anterior and medial temporal lobe and the cingulate gyrus. Incomplete resection of epileptogenic cortex left attached to these structures, may compromise surgical outcome. Given that these connections extend from the posterior edge of the OFR, and that the posterior boundary is intimately linked to multiple structures (anterior perforated substance, optic nerve and anterior cerebral artery) – damage of which can result in significant deficits – an intimate knowledge of the anatomy of the OFR is crucial to successful surgical outcomes.  

Prior descriptions of surgery in the OFR have variously delineated the posterior extent of orbito-frontal excisions as being about $1{-}2\mathrm{cm}$ in front of Broca’s area in the languagedominant hemisphere or extending posteriorly to the ipsilateral internal carotid artery156 and the intersection of the optic and olfactory nerves.107 We find a subpial approach combined with intraoperative frameless stereotactic navigation to be safer, and prefer to use the proximal anterior and middle cerebral arteries (viewed through intact pia) to delimit the resection margins (Figure 37.2).  

The OFR may be approached using three possible trajectories, depending on the nature and location of the lesion (Figure 37.3):  

Lateral frontal;   
Anterior frontal; and   
Intermediate or anterolateral approach, which may be combined with orbito-zygomatic osteotomy.  

The lateral frontal is by far the commonest approach for an OFR resection in the context of epilepsy surgery. This is because many such resections occur in the context of a large fronto-temporo-parietal craniotomy performed for placement of subdural electrodes for invasive electrophysiology. The resection is usually carried out at the time of electrode removal, and the orbital cortex is therefore approached from its lateral aspect. An en bloc resection of all, except the most posterior aspect, of the lateral, posterior and medial orbital gyri, and a portion of the anterior inferior frontal gyrus is carried out. This is followed by subpial aspiration of gyrus rectus. The ipsilateral anterior cerebral artery (ACA) is identified and traced posteriorly to the rostrum of the corpus callosum. Finally, the posterior limits of the orbital gyri and the subcallosal (rostral) cingulate gyrus are aspirated using a subpial technique (Figures 37.4 and 37.5). Identification of the ACA helps determine the posterior extent of the medial resection. The M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) may be used to define the posterior edge of the resection. Use of a subpial technique during the medial and posterior aspect of the resection is crucial in minimizing risks to the anterior perforated substance, olfactory tract, and optic nerves.  

The anterior approach is principally used for excisions of overt OFR lesions and resections in the context of depth electrode recordings. Preoperative placement of a lumbar drain minimizes the need for retraction. A bicoronal scalp incision is made, following which a frontal craniotomy bone flap is elevated – from just above the frontal sinus, just lateral to the midline (and anterior sagittal sinus) and extending laterally to the anterior attachment of the temporalis muscle. A frameless stereotactic system may be used to demarcate the edges of the craniotomy and facilitate approach to the lesion. The dura is opened, with its base on the sagittal sinus, following which the lesion is resected. Subpial techniques should be used when there is a need to remove abnormal (gliotic, hemosiderin stained etc.) cortex surrounding the lesion. A principal advantage of the anterior and antero-lateral approaches is that the inferior frontal gyrus is more easily spared (Figure 37.7).  

The antero-lateral approach, combined with an orbitozygomatic osteotomy may be useful in cases where a large lesion is situated in the postero-medial OFR, and the intention is to minimize dissection and retraction of uninvolved cortex. A frontal craniotomy incision extending to the contralateral midpupillary line is used, following which a frontal craniotomy and orbito-zygomatic osteotomy are carried out. The dura is then opened with its base on the orbital contents, and resection of the lesion is performed. A lumbar drain placed prior to the craniotomy further helps in minimizing retraction.  

Occasionally invasive recordings may suggest independent ictal onsets originating from both the medial temporal and orbitofrontal regions. These cases can be managed with concurrent resections, possibly guided by the judicious use of intra-operative electro-corticography (ECoG) to measure the impact on electric activity in one region after the other is resected. Routine resection of the OFR concurrent with a temporal lobectomy is not recommended – although some authors have adopted a combined approach guided solely by the apparent location of interictal abnormalities.157  

Possible complications related to surgery in the OFR include: infection of the surgical site, osteomyelitis and/or CSF fistulae from opening the frontal sinus mucosa during craniotomy; hemorrhage from injuring the anterior sagittal sinus; venous infarcts when sacrificing veins leading into the sinus; visual deficits following injury to the optic nerve; ischemic events following injury to perforating vessels in the anterior perforating substance; CSF rhinorrhea through the cribriform plate and anosmia if the olfactory nerve and tracts are destroyed; and inadvertent injury to the contralateral frontal lobe if the medial frontal pial layer is not recognized and respected. In addition, there may be impacts upon personality and social behavior following OFR resections – such deficits are not adequately assessed with the current, standard neuropsychological measures employed in patients undergoing epilepsy surgery.  

### Outcome  

There is no systematic study of outcomes related to resections for the treatment of basal frontal lobe epilepsy, and studies examining neuropsychological function in patients with epilepsy arising from this region are lacking. In general, just as for other extratemporal epilepsies, outcomes following resective epilepsy surgery anywhere in the frontal lobe are considered to be ‘not as good’ as those after temporal lobectomy.121,144  

The presence of a lesion on neuroimaging increases the chances for seizure-freedom or significant improvement.35 Cumulative results of surgical treatment for various frontal lobe epilepsies in the pre-MRI era have been characterized as ‘unsatisfactory’ or ‘mediocre’.103 As a rule, results following removal of discrete frontal lesions are superior to those with more diffuse lesions or without demonstrable lesions.66 In a study of 68 consecutive patients, who underwent epilepsy surgery involving the frontal lobe good outcome at last follow-up was reported in $72\%$ of patients with evidence of a lesion on neuroimaging, as compared to only $41\%$ of the ‘nonlesional’ cases.158  

We recently performed a retrospective review of all frontal lobe resections performed by a single neurosurgeon for the treatment of pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation during a 6-year period (from 1998 to 2004). All cases had undergone a comprehensive presurgical evaluation including high-resolution preoperative MR imaging and presentation at a multidisciplinary patient management conference. Out of a total of 130 patients, who had frontal resections during the study period, basal frontal lobe epilepsy was suspected in eight patients.159 In these patients, MRI demonstrated a lesion restricted to the OFR, and/or invasive recordings provided clear evidence for ictal onset within the OFR. Patients with more extensive MRI lesions were excluded. Only two cases were nonlesional (i.e., there was no identifiable structural abnormality on high-resolution anatomical MRI); in three of the six ‘lesional’ cases the MRI detected blurring of the gray-white junction in the medial OFR. Histopathology revealed malformations of cortical development in the majority of patients (5 of 8); cavernomas were found in two, and gliosis in one patient. Resections were restricted to the OFR only in four of the eight patients; the other four underwent larger resections that extended into the lateral frontal region. In this study median follow-up was only 14 months. Seven patients were seizure free, while one had rare seizures postoperatively (Wieser class 3).54  

#### Illustrative case presentation  

The patient is a 33-year-old, right-handed young man with frequent pharmaco-resistant seizures dating back to the age of 26 years. The patient has a history of a motor vehicle accident at the age of 21 years, when he drove into a telephone pole. He lost consciousness upon impact, and had peritraumatic amnesia and a left-sided skull fracture. He did not require neurosurgical intervention and did not experience seizures at the time of the accident.  

Seizures started approximately 5 years later. Initial seizures were primarily nocturnal occurring out of sleep. Family members described ‘whole body convulsions’ followed by stertorous respirations and loss of urine control lasting for less than 1–2 minutes. Postictally the patient reported tiredness, muscle soreness and occasional tongue biting. These seizures have been disabling and have persisted despite several trials of antiepileptic agents with an average frequency of at least one to four per month.  

A second ‘mild seizure type’ was reported. During wakefulness he would have a warning described as ‘feeling unwell’ or having ‘a funny feeling in the head’ lasting for a few seconds, and followed by loss of awareness. Family members described staring and unresponsiveness for 2–3 minutes. During this period the patient had been observed to have complex movements involving the legs and hands. Patient was not sure as to the frequency of this second seizure type. He reported having auras at least once a month.  

He had no history of prolonged, unremitting seizures or physical injury as a result of seizures. He has been unable to work for the last 7 years, because of seizures.  

#### Examination and investigations  

Physical and neurological examinations were normal. Routine outpatient EEG was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an area of focal encephalomalacia in the ventral and basal aspects of the left anterior frontal lobe abutting the roof of the left orbit. The patient was admitted for video-EEG monitoring. Background EEG was normal. Interictal epileptiform activity was recorded predominantly arising from the left temporal region (maximum at the left sphenoidal electrode (Figure 37.6). Less frequent generalized epileptiform discharges with a shifting bifrontal maximum were also present (Figure 37.7). In addition, rare right temporal sharp waves were described.  

Three typical nocturnal seizures were recorded during sleep. They were characterized by an early change in facial expression and unresponsiveness, followed by tonic stiffening and elevation of the right arm (sign of four, right arm extended with the left arm flexed at the elbow), and right head turning preceding the onset of the secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizure.  

Interictal FDG-PET showed mild decrease of FDG uptake in the left orbitofrontal region, corresponding to the area of MRI abnormality. Wada testing (with intracarotid administration of methohexital) demonstrated left hemispheric dominance for language and bilateral memory representation. Baseline neuropsychological evaluation suggested bilateral frontotemporal dysfunction. The patient appeared to have greater difficulties with verbal than visuospatial intellectual measures. He exhibited evidence of compromised executive function in the course of problem solving, impaired verbal memory performance and some deficiencies in vocabulary, naming and reading.  

The case and results of presurgical studies were discussed in a weekly, interdisciplinary patient management conference attended by experts in clinical epileptology, electroencephalography, structural and functional neuroimaging and neuropsychology. The impression was that the patient’s epilepsy may be arising from the left orbitofrontal region ‘perhaps deep in the area of encephalomalacia’. A temporal onset could not be excluded. An invasive evaluation with a combination of chronically implanted subdural and depth electrodes was recommended to further delineate the seizure onset zone, and its relationship to the encephalomalacic lesion (Figure 37.9). In addition, this approach would allow functional mapping of adjacent eloquent cortex (anterior language area) by means of extraoperative electrical cortical stimulation.  

Six typical nocturnal seizures were recorded in the span of 8 days of invasive recordings. All seizures were characterized by focal EEG changes restricted to the mesial, posterior edge of the orbitofrontal plate (Figure 37.10). Based on three-dimensional MRI reconstructions of the electrode location and underlying epileptogenic lesion the area of seizure onset was found to correspond to the posterior edge of the encephalomalacia.  

#### Treatment and outcome  

A resection of the left orbitofrontal and anterior ventral frontal regions was performed. Postoperatively the patient experienced a single breakthrough seizure at 3 months and a cluster of three seizures within one day (in the context of a flulike illness) at approximately 6 months. At his last follow-up the patient has been seizure-free since for more than a year on a stable combination of lamotrigine and levetiracetam.  

## Summary  

The basal frontal lobe is perhaps one of the least explored and least understood regions of the human cerebral cortex. This highly multimodal area is characterized by its functional heterogeneity and widespread connections within the frontal lobes and limbic system. The anterior part of the OFR has the appearance of granular isocortex and is connected to the heteromodal prefrontal cortex. The posterior OFR has a more primitive, dysgranular architectonic appearance and is intimately connected with the limbic system.  

Localization of epileptogenicity arising from the basal frontal lobe is particularly difficult because of the absent or potentially misleading information derived from scalp EEG recordings, and the lack of distinct ictal manifestations. The advent of sophisticated neuroimaging techniques (especially high-resolution anatomical MRI) and the increasing capability to perform invasive recordings from the OFR has made it possible to delineate epileptogenic foci within this region. A limited number of patients with identifiable lesions in the orbitofrontal area and very few patients without evidence of MRI abnormalities have been reported to be seizure free after localized surgical resections. The intimate spatial and functional relationship of the OFR with limbic structures and the reported successes following targeted resections underscore the utility of evaluating this region closely in cases of focal epilepsy presumed to originate in the frontal or temporal lobes.

# 38 Parieto-occipital lobe epilepsy  

## Introduction  

Occipital lobe epilepsy was first recognized by Gowers in $1879^{1}$ when he described a 30-year-old man with ‘epileptoid attacks with visual aura’. The patient described a very brilliant image before him ‘like a gold serpent’. This patient at other times had episodes of transient blindness. The patient was found to have an occipito-parietal tumor at autopsy. Gowers interpreted the aura as follows: ‘at first there was apparently an over action of the center – a bright light; afterwards paroxysmal defective action, due to temporary exhaustion or inhibition, shown in the narrowing of the field of vision’.  

When Gowers examined his records,2 he found that 84 of his 1000 patients with epilepsy exhibited a ‘special sensory aura’ which was referred as ‘the organ or sense of sight’, he subdivided these ‘ocular and visual warnings’ into five categories: a sensation in the eyeball itself, diplopia, an apparent increase or diminution in the size of the objects, loss of sight, and distinct visual sensations such as elementary visual hallucinations.  

The symptomatology of occipital epilepsy was further defined in 1927 by Gordon Holmes3 when he studied patients who had sustained gunshot wounds to the occipital region who exhibited occipital auras, characterized by elementary visual hallucinations or transient blindness, and in 1941 by Penfield and Erickson,4 who described the clinical manifestations of several patients with ‘visual seizures’, including blindness, and coloured moving lights, and were able to elicit the auras by cortical stimulation.  

In 1951 Penfield and Kristiansen5 reported that 11 of 222 patients with focal epilepsy treated surgically had ‘visual sensations’ as the first manifestation of their seizures, characterized as sensations of lights, darkness of colour, and five patients reported that the visual image was ‘revolving’ or ‘rotating’.  

Penfield and Jasper,6 described several patients with ‘visual seizures’, including the patient C.Fr. with a traumatic scar of the pole of the right occipital lobe who had an incomplete left homonymous hemianopia. The patient felt that the seizures were induced by a bright light, to the point that he refused to have the examiner shine a light in his eye. Wilder Penfield stated that ‘This is an example of sensory precipitation of a visual seizure’. The patient described lights followed by blurring of the vision progressing to complete blindness and then a sensation of stiffness in the left hand, and right hand, followed by a generalized seizure. Penfield stated ‘The somatic sensation in both hands suggests that the spread of discharge was from the calcarine cortex to the supplementary area within the sagittal fissure. At the onset of the generalized seizure the head and body turned to the left’.  

Penfield and Jasper7 also reported two patients whose spontaneous seizures began with elementary visual hallucinations, followed by complex visual images. In both patients the habitual complex visual hallucinations were elicited at surgery by stimulation of the right posterior temporal region, suggesting that during the spontaneous attacks the hallucinations probable represented spread of the ictal discharge to the temporal lobe.  

Ludwig and Ajmone Marsan7 reported the clinical manifestations in 55 patients with electrographic evidence of occipital lobe involvement, and noted that as many as two-thirds had lateralized visual manifestations, Blume et al.8 found that in 13 of 19 $(68\%)$ of their patients the most common initial ictal symptoms were visual phenomena, and Williamson et al.9 reported that in 22 of 25 patients $(88\%)$ with occipital lobe epilepsy, early signs or symptoms ‘would had provided clues for the correct diagnosis’. In the series from the Montreal Neurological Institute10 in more than two-thirds of the patients the clinical manifestations indicated the occipital onset of the seizures.  

### Functional anatomy  

Von Economo11 divided the occipital cortex into striate, peristriate, and parastriate regions. The striate cortex contained within the walls of the calcarine fissure, constitutes Brodmann’s area 17, and it is recognized by the thick strip of granular cells in layer IV that is split by the geniculocalcarine band of Gennari. All layers of this cortex reveal marked granularization.  

All six layers of cortex are delineated in the peristriate and parastriate cortices (areas 18 and 19). Numerous pyramidal cells are found in layers II, III, and V and giant pyramidal cells populate area 18, immediately bordering on the striate cortex.  

Jones and Powell12 studied the distribution of projection pathways emanating from areas 17, 18, and 19 by selectively ablating these areas in adult rhesus monkeys. The striate cortex projected to areas 18 and 19, whereas areas 18 and 19 projected fibers to area 8 in the frontal lobe and the adjacent temporal and parietal association cortices. The pathways include the superior longitudinal, the inferior longitudinal and the fronto-occipital fasciculus. Areas 18 and 19 also project deep fibers to the midbrain tegmentum.  

Further elucidation of the occipital lobe functional anatomy arose from electrical cortical stimulation studies in humans undergoing epilepsy surgery. Wilder Penfield and Theodore Rasmussen in the Cerebral Cortex of Man,13 found that 22 patients reported gross visual sensations as the result of stimulation. These visual responses were elementary sensations of light, darkness, and color. They also reported that ‘complicated visual hallucinations do occasionally result from epileptic or electrical stimulation, but these are phenomena of another order and are associated with activation of the temporal lobes’. They observed that ‘the visual responses appear in the secondary visual areas of Brodman (18 and 19) as well as in the primary calcarine area 17. They noted that ‘in general, it would appear that the calcarine image was more often colored while images produced from the secondary visual zone more often consisted of colorless light’.  

### Symptomatology and pathophysiology of occipital lobe seizures  

An analysis of 42 patients with refractory occipital lobe epilepsy treated surgically at the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) between 1930 and $1991^{10}$ showed that the clinical features of occipital lobe epilepsy can be divided into those representing seizure phenomena of occipital lobe origin, which include elementary visual hallucinations, ictal blindness, blinking and ocular movements and those resulting from ictal spread to adjacent cortical areas.  

Fifty-nine percent had visual field deficits. Seventy-three percent of the patients had visual auras. In those patients where the data were available, the elementary visual hallucinations were contralateral to the epileptogenic area. One patient with left occipital microgyria and a right homonymous hemianopsia described ‘dancing lights, whirling lights to the right’ followed by right head and eye deviation, and right head and eye clonic activity. Another patient with left occipital microgyria and a right homonymous hemianopsia described a slowly rotating disk of light in the right visual field. Others described flashing colors, and change in perception of shapes and colors. Another patient with left occipital cortical dysplasia and right upper quadrantanopsia described ‘circles, triangles squares, all colors’, and a visual sensation of movement, followed by conscious right head and eye deviation and right arm posturing. A patient with left occipital gliosis described ‘colored squares of light’ followed by blindness, right head and eye deviation and postictal dysphasia.  

Four patients had elementary visual hallucinations followed by complex visual hallucinations: a 12-year-old with a history of birth trauma and right occipital gliosis had elementary visual aura characterized by colored triangles followed by a complex hallucination in which he saw a robber, or a man with a gun; sinister characters from comic books, followed by conscious adversion to the left, nystagmoid eye movements, left arm clonic activity and postictal left hemiparesis. Another patient with a left hemianopia described ‘a square with a circle in it’, faces, pictures like Rembrandt’s self portrait. The reason for these complex visual hallucinations is most likely ictal spread to the posterior temporal region, as Penfield and Perot14 found that complex visual hallucinations could be elicited by posterior temporal stimulation near the occipital cortex, and Gloor et al.15 reported that experiential phenomena (visual and auditory) ‘did not occur unless a seizure discharge or electrical stimulation involved limbic structures’.  

Ictal blindness has been a consistent symptom of patients with occipital lobe epilepsy. Twenty-eight percent of patients from the MNI had ictal blindness as an initial manifestations of their seizures which lasted as long as a few minutes. A 24- year-old patient with left occipital gliosis described a shadow moving to the right, ‘ombrage’ followed by blindness, and conscious adversion to the right.  

Russel and Whitty16 reported blurring or extinction of vision in $40\%$ of their patients with traumatic occipital lobe epilepsy, and Williamson et al.9 reported that 10 of 25 $(40\%)$ of their patients with occipital lobe epilepsy exhibited ictal amaurosis. Barry et al.17 reported five patients with ictal blindness and electrographic (EEG) monitoring revealed that complete blindness occurred with ictal spread to the contralateral occipital lobe, demonstrating that ictal blindness is caused by seizure induced bilateral occipital lobe dysfunction.  

Other authors have also reported lateralized visual auras in patients with occipital lobe epilepsy, Sveinbjornsdottir and Duncan,18 Aarli and Engelsen,19 Geller et al.,20 Boesebeck et al.,21 Taylor et al.,22 and Blume et al.23  

Other occipital manifestations in the MNI series included eye pulling or moving sensations, blinking, nystagmoid eye movement and contralateral eye movements. Nineteen percent of the MNI patients exhibited blinking and $7\%$ had contralateral nystagmoid eye movements. In one patient, studied with depth electrodes, the nystagmoid eye movements were contralateral to the seizure discharge.  

Munari et al.24 described 16 patients with stereo EEG who had seizures with ocular deviation within the first 10 seconds of the seizure onset. In 14 patients the ocular deviation was tonic and in all was contralateral to the ictal discharge, which generally originated in the medial occipital structures. Cortical stimulation studies in animals and humans demonstrate that eye movements can be initiated by occipital mechanisms.25,26  

Contralateral head and eye deviation was present in half of the MNI patients. Two of these patients were studied with depth electrodes and had contralateral head and eye deviation while the seizure remained localized to the occipital lobe. Ludwig and Ajmone-Marsan7 reported contraversive movements of head and eyes in $29\%$ of their 55 patients.  

Automatisms similar to those from patients with temporal lobe epilepsy occurred in $50\%$ , and focal motor activity in $38\%$ of the MNI patients, and one-third of the patients had more than one seizure type. Ajmone-Marsan and Ralston27 suggested that seizures originating in the occipital lobe could have multiple spread patterns. Subsequently this was confirmed by intracranial recordings in humans28,29 and animal experimental data.30 The inferior longitudinal, superior longitudinal and the fronto-occipital fasciculus are involved in this spread.  

### Etiologies of occipital lobe epilepsy  

Rasmussen,31 identified the etiology of refractory occipital lobe epilepsy, established by history and pathological findings in 23 patients; one-third had a history of head trauma or anoxia; $9\%$ had gliomas and $13\%$ postinflamatory brain scarring. In $26\%$ of patients no cause could be determined. The remaining patients had other lesions including pial angiomatosis. In the updated series of 42 patients from the  

MNI, $21\%$ had a history of significant head trauma with loss of consciousness, $24\%$ had a history suuggestive of birth trauma or hypoxia, $7\%$ had a history suggestive of encephalitis, and $10\%$ had slow growing glial tumors. Others had focal cortical dysplasia.  

Ludwig and Ajmone-Marsan7 reported that $24\%$ of their patients had a history of birth injury, hypoxia, and severe head trauma; $13\%$ had a history of encephalitis or meningitis; $14\%$ vascular lesions, and $7\%$ expanding lesions. In $25\%$ the etiology was unknown. A recent series from the Yale Epilepsy Center, of 35 patients with intractable occipital lobe epilepsy treated between 1986 and 1995, reported that most of their patients had developmental abnormalities or tumors,32 and Lee et al.33 reported that 20 of 26 of their patients with occipital lobe epilepsy had a pathological diagnosis of cortical dysplasia.  

### EEG findings in occipital epilepsy  

In the MNI series, the most common location of interictal epileptiform discharges was the posterior temporal-occipital region $(46\%)$ . Interictal epileptiform discharges were localized to the occipital lobe in only $18\%$ of patients. One-third of the patients had synchronous lower amplitude epileptiform discharges from the contralateral homologous head regions, suggesting secondary bilateral synchrony. Bitemporal interictal epileptiform discharges were recorded, in $24\%$ of the patients. This is probably a manifestation of secondary bilateral synchrony and/or secondary epileptogenesis.34,35  

The most common type of surface ictal onset was regional involving the posterior temporal occipital region. Ictal onsets on surface recordings restricted to the occipital lobe were seen in only four out of 24 patients $(17\%)$ . Six patients had intracranial recordings with depth electrodes. Ictal onsets were predominantly regional rather than focal and involved widespread areas of the mesial and lateral occipital cortex, often involving the supra and infracalcarine structures and, in some seizures, the posterior temporal region. The most common pattern of spread involved the ipsilateral temporol-mesial structures.  

Aykut-Bingol et al.32 found that of 35 patients who had occipital lobe epilepsy surgery between 1986 and 1995, interictal scalp EEG was localized to the occipital, temporal, and occipitotemporal regions in $17\%$ , $27\%$ , and $24\%$ of patients, respectively. Ictal events were recorded in 30 patients. Ictal onset was localized to the occipital lobe in $30\%$ , and temporal and occipitotemporal in $27\%$ ; in the rest it was more diffuse. Nineteen patients underwent intracranial EEG studies. Foldvary et al.36 analyzed the localizing value of ictal EEG in focal epilepsy, and found that ‘false localization/ lateralization occurred in $28\%$ of occipital seizures.’  

## Parietal lobe epilepsy  

### Historical background, and functional anatomy  

Wilder Penfield, Theodore Rasmussen, and their colleagues divided their patients with refractory epilepsy into those whose epileptogenic areas involved the frontal, central (sensorimotor area), parietal and occipital regions.4,6,13  

Patients with epileptogenic lesions involving the pre- and post-central gyrus were grouped together, because lesions in this cortex produced sensorimotor deficits, and as Penfield and Erickson4 stated ‘the precentral and postcentral gyri in man constitute a functional unit. Close interrelationship of motor and sensory cortical areas is established by the numerous connecting U-shaped fibers which pass under the bottom of the central fissure’.  

Penfield and Rasmussen,13 noted that ‘by Parietal area is meant that portion of the classical parietal lobe which lies behind the post central gyrus’, ‘if the lower parietal area which constitutes the parietal speech area on the dominant side be excluded, the superior parietal cortex could be removed with a comparatively small functional penalty’. Penfield and Erickson4 had described that ablation of the parietal association cortex left little obvious functional deficits though ‘disturbances of speech and disturbances in perception of form in the opposite homonymous visual field has been noted’.  

Rasmussen37 continued to use the functional division of the brain developed by Foerster and Penfield,38 since their definition of the parietal lobe differs from the generally employed in reviewing the MNI series of parietal lobe epilepsy, we refer to ‘parietal association area’ to define the region behind the postcentral gyrus and in front of the occipital lobe.  

Foerster and Penfield,38 described patients with epileptogenic lesions and ‘parietal field attacks’, characterized by painful sensations, vertigo, paresthesias, head and eye deviation, a sense of movement of one extremity, visual illusions, and complex movements of arms and legs, and reproduced these symptoms by faradic stimulation.  

Cushing39 expanded on these observations when he described 12 patients with parietal meningiomas; nine of them had a contralateral sensory aura, described as numbness, tingling, painful sensation or a feeling of warmth or heat. Since then few series of patients with parietal lobe epilepsy have been reported.  

### Clinical manifestations and pathophysiology  

Patients with parietal lobe epilepsy with epileptogenic areas in the parietal cortex behind the postcentral gyrus, comprised $6\%$ of patients operated at the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) between 1929 and 1980.40,41  

Eighty-two patients had nontumoral parietal lobe epilepsy (Figure 38.1), with a mean age of seizure onset of 14.1 years and mean duration of epilepsy 8.1 years. Twelve patients had contralateral sensory deficits which were found during detailed examination and consisted of contralateral impaired two pointpoint discrimination, isolated diminished stereognosis, without two point discrimination, was reported in only two patients. Sixteen percent of patients had smallness of the contralateral extremities, $8\%$ contralateral visual field deficits, most commonly inferior quadrantic defects. Impairment of spatial orientation and right–left disorientation were described in three patients, disturbance in the field of written language, and mild aphasia in two others.  

Ninety-four percent of patients exhibited auras. The most common were somatosensory, described by 52 patients as tingling or numbness; they were contralateral to the epileptogenic zone in 51 patients and bilateral in one; 13 of these patients described a painful, and five a thermal sensation. The second most common auras were disturbances of body image exhibited by nine patients; three patients mentioned a sensation of movement in one extremity, and another a sensation that the leg was absent. Twisting or turning sensations of the extremities were also described.

Figure 38.1 Original operative map of patient A. H. operated on by Dr Penfield in 1946. 25 year old with history of head trauma. The seizures were described as ‘does not know where he is, cannot concentrate, cannot see well’, followed by turning to the left.  

Visual illusions were reported by nine patients as ‘figures look larger’ or ‘things on the wall turning’. A few patients exhibited complex visual or auditory hallucinations, suggesting ictal spread to temporo-limbic areas.15 Eighty patients underwent intraoperative cortical stimulation studies and the habitual auras were reproduced in $55\%$ of patients. These included auras with a disturbance of body image or visual illusions, indicating an epileptogenic zone in the parietal association cortex. However, somatosensory auras also occurred in patients with lesions limited to the parietal association cortex, suggesting ictal spread to the somatosensory cortex. Thus, the symptomatogenic zones were distant from the epileptogenic zones in the parietal association cortex, Luders and Awad.43  

### Other seizure characteristics  

The other clinical manifestations were due to ictal spread. The ictal semiology indicated several dominant spread patterns, including spread to the sensorimotor cortex, the premotor eyefield, supplementary motor area, and the temporolimbic region. Twenty-eight percent had tonic posturing of the extremities, $57\%$ had focal motor activity, $17\%$ had oral-gestural automatisms, and $4\%$ had complex automatisms. Fortyone percent had head deviation, $22\%$ had Todd’s paralysis and $7\%$ had postictal dysphasia.  

Many patients had more than one seizure type reflecting the different spread patterns. Sixty-one percent of patients with tonic posturing had epileptogenic zones which included the superior parietal lobule, and $79\%$ of those with automatisms had epileptogenic zones extending into the inferior parietal lobule. This suggest preferential spread with ictal activity from the superior parietal lobule more commonly spreading to the supplementary motor area, and the one from the inferior parietal lobe to the temporo-limbic areas. This pattern of spread is supported by Reesnick et al.,44 who used subdural electrodes in the evaluation of patients with refractory epilepsy, and is a reflection of the connection of the parietal lobe with the supplementary motor area, and with the temporo-limbic region,.45,46  

Other authors and recent reviews have also reported asymmetrical tonic seizures and automatisms in patients with parietal lobe epilepsy, and have emphasized that many of these patients have more than one seizure type.18,47–50  

### Etiologies of nontumoral parietal lobe epilepsy  

Thirty-five patients from the MNI series had a history of head trauma, and $16\%$ had a history of birth trauma. The remaining patients had a history of encephalitis, febrile convulsions, gunshot wounds to the head, forme fruste of tuberous sclerosis, hamartomas, vascular malformations, tuberculoma, arachnoid or porencephalic cysts, microgyria and post-traumatic thrombosis of the middle cerebral artery.  

### Tumoral parietal lobe epilepsy  

Thirty-four of 116 patients $(29\%)$ from the MNI series with parietal lobe epilepsy had slow growing tumors (Figure 38.2), most commonly astrocytomas $(62\%)$ and meningiomas $(14\%)$ . The remaining patients had hemangiomas, oligodendrogliomas, and mixed astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma.  

Forty-seven percent had impaired two point discrimination in the contralateral fingers, $38\%$ had mild contralateral weakness, $6\%$ aphasia, $3\%$ smaller extremities contralateral to the epileptogenic zone, one right to left disorientation and acalculia and two spatial disability. Only one patient exhibited definite astereognosis without coexisting primary sensory cortical deficit.  

Seventy-nine percent exhibited auras, most commonly somatosensory, contralateral to the the epileptogenic zone in all except for one patient. Four described a painful sensation. Twelve percent had visual illusions, $9\%$ aphasic aurae, $6\%$ disturbance of body image, $3\%$ complex auditory hallucinations, and $3\%$ a feeling of movement in one arm. Some patients had two or more auras.

Figure 38.2 Original operative map of patient E. $\mathrm{O^{\prime}k}$ operated on by Dr Penfield in 1947. 25 year old with weakness of left foot and absent two-point discrimination in left leg. The seizures began by a sensation in the left great toe, tingling in the left vulva, spreading to left breast (not sexual), followed by left leg and left arm jerking.  

The clinical manifestations indicated different spread patterns; $21\%$ had tonic posturing of the extremities, $28\%$ had focal clonic activity always contralateral to the epileptogenic lesion, $15\%$ had head deviation, $9\%$ automatisms, and $6\%$ difficulty speaking. Thirty-two percent had Todd’s paralysis and $18\%$ had post-ictal dysphasia.  

### EEG findings in parietal epilepsy  

Surface EEG was available in 66 patients of the nontumoral parietal lobe epilepsy MNI series and seizures were recorded in 36 patients. The interictal epileptiform discharges were recorded from the fronto-centro-parietal region in $33\%$ of patients, parieto-posterior temporal in $14\%$ , parietal in $14\%$ , parieto-occipital in $9\%$ , fronto-centro-temporal in $4.5\%$ , fronto-temporal-parietal in $4.5\%$ , hemispheric, maximum posterior head region in $9\%$ , and bilateral in $4.5\%$ . No interictal epileptiform discharges were recorded in $7.5\%$ of patients. Secondary bilateral synchrony was described in $32\%$ of patients. Ictal discharges were predominantly lateralized, in some patients the maximum ictal activity was recorded over the centro-parietal region and in others over the posterior head region. Localized parietal seizure onset was recorded in four patients.  

Williamson et al.47 and Cascino et al.48 emphasized that surface EEG monitoring is often non-localizing in parietal lobe epilepsy, and Foldvary et al.36 reported false localization/lateralization in $16\%$ of parietal lobe seizures.  

## Conclusions  

In more than two-thirds of the patients with occipital lobe epilepsy, clinical manifestations indicated the occipital onset of the seizures. Visual auras were reported in $47-73\%$ of patients. Most patients exhibited contralateral elementary visual auras, and a few exhibited ictal blindness. Seven to nine percent of patients exhibited nystagmoid eye movements. Many of the disabling clinical manifestations resulted from ictal spread to adjacent cortical structures, $29\mathrm{-}88\%$ of patients exhibited automatisms typical of temporal lobe epilepsy, and $38\mathrm{-}47\%$ had focal motor activity. Some patients had more than one seizure type reflecting these different spread patterns. Contralateral visual field deficits were reported in $20\mathrm{-}59\%$ , and abnormal imaging studies in $37-72\%$ of patients. EEG recordings often showed posterior temporaloccipital interictal epileptiform discharges, and ictal onsets were regional often involving the posterior temporal region. A quarter of patients had bitemporal independent interictal epileptiform discharges, and one-third had bilateral synchronous epileptiform discharges over the posterior head regions.  

Ninety-four percent of patients with parietal lobe epilepsy exhibited auras. The most common auras were somatosensory, including painful sensations. However the auras experienced by some patients, like disturbance of body image may have indicated an epileptogenic zone in the association parietal cortex. The ictal semiology indicated several dominant spread patterns; $28\%$ had tonic posturing of extremities, $57\%$ focal motor clonic activity, and $17\%$ had oral-gestural automatisms. The surface EEG was often lateralizing rather than localizing. Brain tumors are often the cause of parietal lobe epilepsy and were found in one-third of 116 MNI patients.

# 39 Insular epilepsy  

## Introduction  

The concept of insular epilepsy was debated in the early fifties when it was observed that insular stimulation could evoke symptoms very similar to those of temporal lobe seizures. This similarity could be such that confusion between insular and temporal lobe seizures might explain some of the failures of temporal lobectomy. In ‘Historical background and basic concepts’ we review the historical background and concepts on which are grounded recent depth Stereotactic EEG (SEEG) studies aiming at identifying the actual symptoms reflecting discharges located in the insular lobe. ‘The insula as an ictal symptomatogenic area’ is devoted to the description of an ictal symptomatic sequence, which occurs in full consciousness, and is highly suggestive of an epileptic discharge in the insular lobe. Based on SEEG recordings of spontaneous seizures and stimulation data, this sequence includes an initial pharyngeal and/or laryngeal discomfort with thoracic oppression or dyspnea, unpleasant paresthesiae, warmth or pain sensation in the perioral region or spreading to a large somatic territory, followed by dysarthric or dysphonic speech and ending by focal somato-motor manifestations. Several cortical areas, with which the insula is connected, are involved in most of the focal seizures originating in, or spreading to, the insula. Based on clinical observation of ictal symptomatology, invasive EEG investigations must be targeted to explore the whole extent of the suspected epileptogenic network in order to assess the role of the insula in seizure development. ‘The insula as a mode in distributed epileptogenic networks’ provides the arguments supporting identification of three major epileptogenic networks (temporo-perisylvian, temporo-limbic and mesialorbital frontal) where the insula participates as a node in the building of ictal symptomatology, including that of nocturnal frontal hypermotor seizures where the antero-superior part of the insula can be a clinically silent seizure onset zone. The final three sections are devoted to the review of etiologies, presurgical evaluation and treatment of insular epilepsies. Most cases reported in the literature as insular epilepsies are symptomatic of a focal epileptogenic lesion located in the insula, some of which were successfully operated upon, while the few cases of cryptogenic epilepsies hitherto available are those reported in this chapter. EEG plays a minor role for investigating insular epilepsies because interictal paroxysms and seizures originating in the insula are unlikely to be detected by scalp recordings. The roles of MEG and functional interictal neuroimaging remain incertain as well as the results of insular surgical resection based on SEEG data or of SEEG-guided thermo-coagulation in cryptogenic cases. Conversely seizure freedom can be obtained after surgical resection of the lesion in symptomatic cases, provided that ictal symptoms are compatible with an epileptogenic zone located close to the lesion in the insular lobe.  

### Historical background and basic concepts  

#### The insula as the fifth lobe of the brain  

In an article published in 1896 that was devoted to the comparative anatomy of the insula, Clark1 quoted 39 synonyms used in anatomical literature to name the fifth lobe of the brain buried in the lateral sulcus and covered by the opercular parts of the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, among which the term insula, first proposed by Reil in 1804, has prevailed. The anatomical situation of the insula and its cytoarchitectonic organization lent some substance to the view that it might be an isolated lobe of the brain mostly devoted to the processing of body and visceral sensation including gustation, pain and other emotions, and to viscero-motor and autonomic control. In monkeys the insula includes Brodmann’s areas 13 to 16 and shows a caudo-rostral sequence of distinct cytoarchitectonic areas namely; a granular cortex, at its upper and posterior part, very similar to that of the second somatosensory (SII) area and involved mostly in somatosensory, pain and auditory functions; a transitional dysgranular field localized in its antero-superior part involved in gustation and and viscero-sensitive functions; an antero-ventral agranular field, which is in continuity with the temporal pole and olfactory proisocortex, and related to olfactory and autonomic functions (see ref 2 for a review).  

For the past 10 years the question of insular physiology has been addressed by numerous studies using neuroimaging, evoked potentials and direct stimulation in humans as well as microelectrode studies in monkeys. These studies have confirmed the role of the insula in:  

Somatosensory and pain sensation as assessed by numerous anatomical,3,4 functional imaging studies5–8, as well as by our recent studies of somato-sensory and pain evoked responses9 and direct electric stimulation of the Insular cortex10, 11   
Visceral sensation and viscero-motor control12–14 including processing of visceral pain15   
Cardiovascular function as demonstrated by insular stimulation in epileptic patients before temporal lobectomy that produced changes in heart rate or in blood pressure  

in $50\%$ of cases,16 thus leading to suspect a role of insular discharges in cardiac arrhythmias causing sudden death during epileptic seizures. Gustation as assessed first by the stimulation studies of Penfield and Faulk17 and further confirmed by neuroimaging studies18, 31 as well as by microelectrode recordings of a large number of insular neurons in monkeys,20 these physiological findings being consistent with the altered taste perception observed in patients with insular lesion.21 Audition and language, in particular allocation of auditory attention, tuning in to novel auditory stimuli, temporal and phonological processing of auditory stimuli.22 Furthermore several studies suggest that both right and left insulae are involved in the control of speech production.23–28  

More recently, some studies suggested that the insular lobe could belong to the mirror-neuron system that characterizes regions of the brain that are able to respond when the subject performs an action and when the subject observes another individual doing a similar action (see ref 29 for a review), but also regions able to encode for a sensation (or emotion) perceived by the subject and to respond to the observation of others experiencing that sensation (or emotion). In the human insula regions involved in visceral sensation or viscero-motor responses also respond to faces expressing disgust.30,31 Similarly the human insula responds to both pain perception and empathy for others’ pain.32  

From what precedes one can conclude that the insula represents a highly organized lobe with specific functions comparable to the other lobes of the brain and, therefore, consider that an epileptogenic zone located in this area will cause seizures characterized by a specific ictal symptomatology. This point is addressed in details in the second section of this chapter where we discuss the localizing value of a sequence of ictal symptoms that are highly suggestive of an epileptic discharge affecting the insula.  

#### The insula as a node in distributed cortical networks  

As the other lobes of the brain, the insula is characterized by anatomical borders that are defined by a limiting sulcus (the circuminsular fissure) but also by fuzzy cytoarchitectonic borders with neighboring cortical areas and by a dense network of cortico-cortical connections with adjacent or more distant cortical areas. Therefore its function, as well as its implication in epileptic seizure development, cannot be sketched as an isolated functional center, as suggested by the term ‘insula’. A complete description of insular connections is given in the review by Augustine2 showing that the insula is connected with the limbic areas, the amygdalar nucleus, the basal ganglia, and all of the cortical lobes, except the occipital lobe. Several attempts have been made to identify functional networks in which the insula could play the role of a functional node.33–35 Among these networks the perisylvian-insular, the temporolimbic-insular, and the mesial-orbito-frontal-insular networks deserve the attention of epileptologists because epileptic discharges propagating in each of them will produce seizures where the symptoms attributable to the insula will reflect only part of the ictal symptomatology. In part III of this chapter we discuss the difficulties in identifying insular epilepsy among epilepsies where the epileptogenic zone spreads outside the limits of the insular lobe, and the utility of the concept of epileptogenic networks for planning the depth electrodes implantation in the presurgical evaluation of these patients.  

### The concept of insular epilepsy  

In the late forties and early fifties Guillaume et al.36 followed by Penfield and Jasper37 were the first authors to call attention upon the concept of insular epilepsy. Penfield and Faulk38 concluded the review of their personal experience of insular stimulation by noting that the majority of the positive responses to stimulation of the insula consisted either in sensations resembling that produced by stimulation of the superior bank of the sylvian fissure (SII area), or in abdominal feeling secondary to motor change in the gastrointestinal tract. This latter finding suggested that seizures originating in the insular cortex were able to mimic temporal lobe seizures to such a degree that confusion between the two types of seizures might explain part of temporal lobectomy failures.36 This concept was mostly based on data from electrocorticography (EcoG) carried out during the surgical treatment of patients suffering from temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) under local anaesthesia. Moreover EcoG recordings revealed a rich interictal spiking paroxysmal activity in about half of these patients.34 However, in spite of an EcoG strategy exploring systematically the insula, Penfield and his collaborators never succeeded to record spontaneous epileptic discharges with a focal onset in the insular cortex. Furthermore they were unable to provide the argument that insular cortectomy, as a complement to conventional temporal lobectomy in TLE patients, could improve the surgical outcome.39 Thus the concept that specific symptoms could reflect insular discharges into the insular lobe fell into dereliction. More recently, several case reports showed that seizures could be stopped by the surgical removal of insular lesions40–42 and reactivated the research for identifying the insula as a symptomatogenic area in focal epilepsy.  

### The insula as an ictal symptomatogenic area  

Identification of a given cortical area as a symptomatogenic zone is mostly based on correlations between the ictal symptomatology and data from ictal discharge recordings using invasive EEG procedures.43 In the case of the insular lobe such correlations are often uneasy because, even though the insula is frequently involved during temporal lobe seizures, most insular discharges develop concomitanty in the temporal, perisylvian, or frontal cortex, so that symptoms reflecting discharges in the insular cortex are difficult to disentangle from those related to the involvement of these neighboring areas in the building of ictal symptomatology. The patients’ file of our department reflects the rarity of focal seizures involving exclusively, or preferentially, the insular lobe. Of the 180 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) referred to our department for presurgical evaluation since 1996, 83 were explored using depth electrodes implanted in the lateral and mesial regions of the temporal lobe, of whom 50 also had depth electrodes implanted in the insular. We have been able to identify an ictal symptomatic sequence associated with a focal discharge restricted to the insula in only eight of them $(16\%)$ .  

### Ictal symptoms reflecting seizure activity in the insula  

What we know about the electroclinical manifestations of insular seizures mostly stems from SEEG data from a few patients referred mostly for TLE surgery. Electrode implantation in the insula is usually decided on the basis of ictal symptoms or scalp video-EEG data suggesting an early spread of seizures either to the suprasylvian opercular cortex, such as tonic or clonic mouvements of the face, dysarthria or motor aphasia, gustatory hallucinations, hypersalivation, post ictal facial paresis,44 or to the infrasylvian opercular cortex such as auditory hallucinations or early sensory aphasia.45 For the description of insular ictal symptoms we selected seizures that were characterized by a SEEG discharge involving selectively the insula at any moment of the seizure development. In six patients discharges originated from the insula itself (cases 3 to 8 in Figure 39.1) and in two (cases 1 and 2 in Figure 39.1) discharges originated in the hippocampus but propagated exclusively to the insular cortex without spreading to any other cortical structure. Video recordings of patients’ behavior during insular seizures are illustrated in Figure 39.1. The five ictal features that were invariant in repeated seizures in a given individual and observed when the ictal discharge selectively involved the insular cortex are the following:  

(a) Consciousness and contact with the environment are fully preserved  

(b) Paresthesiae (lines B and C in Figure 39.1) represent the second feature that is reported by all patients during insular discharges. They are described as an unpleasant sensation of electricity or warmth that can be painful (2/8). They are either restricted to peri-or intra-oral areas (line B in Figure 39.1), or distributed to a large cutaneous territory (face-shoulder-arm and trunk, upper limb-trunklower limb) most often opposite to the insular discharge (line C in Figure 39.1), or bilateral (2/8) affecting either territories close to midline, such as mouth and oral cavity (1B and 2B in Figure 39.1), or more distal somatotopic areas such as both lower limbs (3C in Figure 39.1). Although the onset site and spreading of paresthesiae can vary from one seizure to the other, there is usually no somatotopic Jacksonian march as often reported in SI somatosensory seizures.46  

(c) Motor and sensory pharyngo-laryngeal symptoms are other frequent manifestations (6/8) that are accompanied by the spontaneous gesture of seizing the neck with the hand ipsi- or contralateral to the discharge, or with boths hands, as illustrated in patients 1–6 in Figure 39.1 (line A). This sensation can be isolated or preceded, or followed, by other sensations such as a retro-sternal or abdominal heaviness that can be accompanied by rumbling noises and vomiting (image 1B in Figure 39.1), or a short breath with dyspnea as reported in the early descriptions of anterior insular stimulations by Penfield and Faulk.38 Its intensity is variable according to patients and is described either as an unpleasant sensation of throat constriction, or as the sensation that the salivary glands are under pressure preceding hypersalivaltion (image 2A–5A in Figure 39.1), or even as a terrifying sensation of strangulation with suffocation (images 1A and 6A in Figure 39.1).  

(d) A dysphonic and dysarthric speech evolving progressively toward a complete muteness is as frequent as the laryngeal sensation described above (6/8). It may persist several tens of seconds after the end of the discharge.  

(e) Finally, the clinical manifestations of insular seizures often (5/8) end with motor symptoms (cases 4–8, line D in Figure 39.1) that are either lateralized and opposite to the discharge (tonic spasm of face and upper limb), or more diffuse (head and eyes rotation, generalized dystonia). In a given patient the occurrence of motor symptoms is usually inconstant from one seizure to the other.

Figure 39.1 Video sequence of ictal symptoms in the eight patients with insular seizures. Empty areas correspond to missing symptoms in the sequence. All illustrated seizures are simple partial seizures with complete preservation of contact during phases A, B, and C of the sequence. A brief loss of contact occurred in phase D for patients 6 and 7 in association with intense somatomotor convulsive symptoms. A: Laryngeal constriction (6 patients). B: Paresthesiae in the perioral region (6 patients). C: Lateralized somatosensory symptoms in upper limb (7 patients). D: Focal somatomotor symptoms (5 patients). \*For patient 3 somatomotor symptoms(D) did not occur during the three Video-SEEG recorded seizures, while most of spontaneous seizures in patient’s history ended by this type of symptoms. Colored frames distinguish rostral (green) from caudal (red) insular seizures. Green frame: symptoms associated with anterior insular ictal discharge Red frame symptoms associated with posterior insular ictal discharge.  

When observed at any given moment in the seizure such symptoms suggest that the insular lobe is included in the symptomatogenic zone; when observed at the onset of seizures they indicate that the insula should be involved in the surgically resected area to achieve postsurgical control of seizures; when an insular lesion is present their occurrence at seizure onset suggests that the epileptogenic zone is close to the lesion. This latter statement is illustrated by the patient whose brain MRI is shown in Figure 39.2. This female patient, aged 22, had suffered since the age of 16 from seizures begining by unpleasant and intense paresthesiae that involved a large proportion of the left side of her body including face, whole upper limb and trunk followed by a ‘strange taste’ in her mouth. Her seizures ended with hypersalivation and clonic jerks in her left face. MRI showed a cavernous angioma located in the posterior insular cortex, the removal of which was followed by the disappearance of seizures. Since surgery this patient has remained free of seizures and antiepileptic drugs, with a postsurgery follow-up of two years.  

#### Localization specificity of insular ictal symptoms: data from direct electric cortical stimulations  

Electric stimulation of the insula in patients presenting with one or more of the above listed ictal symptoms is useful for mapping the symptomatogenic area when it reproduces symptoms that are immediately identified by the patient as identical to their spontaneous ictal symptoms. Thus lateralized and widely distributed paresthesiae could be triggered by stimulation in five of the eight patients whose ictal behavior is shown in Figure 39.1 (cases 1, 3, 5, 6 and 8), focal perioral paresthesiae in four (cases 1, 2, 3, and 6), laryngeal sensation in three (cases 2, 4, and 5), dysarthric speech in one (case 5) and abdominal pain in one (case 1).

Figure 39.2 Sagittal (a), coronal (b) and axial (c) MRI slice showing a right posterior insular cavernous angioma in a patient with painful seizures on the left side of the body, who became seizure free after lesionnectomy (see text for details).  

More generally direct stimulation of the insula, even in patients whose seizures are of extrainsular origin, is able to elicit all of the ictal symptoms of insular seizures. In our experience, the insula is one of the most eloquent cortical areas when electrically stimulated by shocks47 or trains11 at low intensities (1–3 mA). Insular stimulation sites explored in our group of 50 consecutive patients are plotted in Figure 39.3. Of these 144 sites, 125 were clinically responsive to stimulation in the absence of any after discharge, and a total amount of 139 evoked clinical responses could be collected (Figure 39.3b). Thirty-one of them were identified by the patients as identical to one of the ictal symptoms of their spontaneous seizures, 108 were reported as unknown and not belonging to the usual ictal symptomatology. As for ictal symptoms, these responses can be subdivided into five main categories: somatosensory (Figure $39.3\mathrm{Ca})$ , viscerosensitive (Figure 39.3Cb and c), auditory (Figure $39.3\mathrm{Cd})$ ), dysarthria and missing words (Figure $39.3\mathrm{Ce}$ ), others including sensation of unreality, whole body sensations, olfacto-gustatory hallucinations, and vegetative responses (Figure 39.3Cf).  

Somato- or viscero-sensory responses represent nearly twothirds of evoked responses, of which more than half concern the cervical-laryngeal region. There is thus converging evidence from seizure analysis and stimulation data that these somatosensory symptoms, particularly in case of warmth or pain sensation, suggest an ictal involvement of the posterior insula.  

Similarly the laryngeal and visceral sensations reported by our patients during their seizures, and reproduced by electric stimulation suggest an anterior insular propagation of the epileptic discharge. This conclusion contrasts with the commonly accepted view that visceral and laryngeal ictal sensations indicate a hippocampal or amygdalar origin when observed in the context of TLE seizures.48, 49  

Auditory symptoms and dysarthric speech immediately follow somatic and visceral sensations, in terms of frequency, in the list of responses evoked by insular stimulation. Auditory symptoms are currently attributed to ictal discharges in the temporal operculum and first temporal gyrus. Our data suggest that they may also reflect an insular propagation of the discharge. However, there are no types of auditory illusions or hallucinations that can be considered as specific to insular ictal semiology, because stimulation of the Heschl’s gyrus can evoke auditory symptoms very similar to those produced by insular stimulation. Conversely, though dysarthria is considered to reflect frontal opercular discharges,50 we never observed this symptom in isolation when stimulating this region outside Broca’s area. Moreover, ictal dysarthria was associated with discharges in the nondominant hemisphere for language in the three patients whose insular seizures included this symptom, and it was reproduced as often in the right or left hemisphere by direct cortical stimulation.  

Somato-motor ictal manifestations differ from others in that they usually cannot be reproduced by insular stimulation and reflect seizure propagation outside the insular lobe. They have been considered as predictors of a bad outcome in temporal lobectomy and their occurrence makes questionable the diagnosis of TLE.51 Indeed such symptoms are exceptional in seizures originating in the mesial temporal lobe, while they occur at the end of nearly two-thirds of insular seizures. Thus, in patients whose ictal symptomatology is compatible with TL seizures, their occurrence during the development of the seizure strongly suggests a seizure onset in the insular lobe.

The two deepest contacts of each electrode are located in the insular cortex. The more superficial contacts are located in the suprasylvian (i1) and infrasylvian opercular cortex (i2 and i3). (R: right, L: left). B: Plotting of the 144 insular contacts (yellow dots) in the 50 patients on a sagittal MRI slice of the insula. The borders of the insular lobe are drawn in red.

This figure illustrates data from direct electrical stimulations of the insular cortex in the 50 patients of this study. In each of the six Ca to Cf insets all of the 144 stimulated points are plotted as black circles (see ref. 11 for details on stimulation procedure, safety and accuracy). The 138 responses evoked by electrical stimulations are represented according to the functional categories detailed in the results section. Ca: Somatosensory responses.

Cf: Miscellaneous responses: Sensation of unreality (light blue); Olfacto-gustatory responses (orange); Vestibular responses (pink), Vegetative responses (purple). From Isnard et al. 2004 with permission.69 (See Color plates.)  

Finally, $10\%$ of the responses evoked by insular stimulation (Figure 39.3Cf) reproduce ictal manifestations that are only occasionally observed in spontaneous insular seizures such as vegetative responses, feeling of unreality, olfacto-gustatory and visceral sensations. The insular origin of these rare symptoms is in agreement with the functional role of the insular lobe in the control of taste52–56 and visceral functions.31, 57  

None of our patients with SEEG documented insular seizures reported vertigo or sensation of body tilting as part of their ictal symptomatology and insular stimulation exceptionally produced a vestibular sensation (3/139: $2.1\%$ , purple points in Figure 39.3Cf). This finding contrasts with some observations where parieto-insular strokes manifested by such sensations.58–60 It is in line with cortical stimulation data by Penfield and Jasper37 and more recently by Kahane et al.61 showing that vestibular sensations are mostly observed after stimulation of the superior temporal neocortex and lateral aspect of the inferior parietal cortex.  

### What, if anything, is an insular seizure?  

Based on the above detailed observations is it possible to add an ‘insular’ category to the list of epileptogenic zones that can be used as one of the dimensions of a patient-oriented epilepsy classification?62 In other words, is there any sequence of symptoms that are specific enough to locate the epileptogenic area in the insula and to predict that the removal of the insular cortex is necessary to make the patient seizure free? Even though SEEG-documented seizures are scarce an affirmative answer can be given to this question when, during spontaneous seizures, the patient experiences in full consciousness a symptomatic sequence made of a pharyngeal and/or laryngeal discomfort with thoracic oppression or dyspnea, unpleasant paresthesiae, warmth or pain sensation in the perioral region or spreading to a large somatic territory, followed by dysarthric or dysphonic speech and ending in focal somato-motor manifestations. Knowing that in patients illustrated in Figure 39.1, most of the antero superior quadrant of the insula has not been explored (see Figure 39.3), two variants can be distinguished according to whether the insular discharge originates from the anterior or posterior part of the insula. In rostral insular seizures viscero-motor and laryngeal symptoms are predominant (green frame in Figure 39.1), while in caudal insular seizures the ictal symptomatology is dominated by somato-sensory symptoms, which are all the more so specific that they affect a large, eventually bilateral, territory and manifest as a warm or painful sensation (red frame in Figure 39.1)! Thus most of the insular seizures can be described as a combination of vegetative and somatosensory auras according to the semiological seizure classification proposed by Lüders et al.63  

### The insula as a node in distributed epileptogenic networks  

As for any other types of partial seizures, the concept of a distributed epileptogenic network can be applied to describe insular seizures where the insular cortex is involved as a node, or as a relay in seizure propagation, and not as a single focus. This situation is likely to be more frequent than that where seizures remain confined to the insular cortex. The occurrence of a sequence of ictal symptoms reflecting the insular involvement at seizures clinical onset, as described above, proves effective to delineate the various clinical situations where epileptic discharges might originate in the insula. It must be reminded, however, that identification of these symptoms does not allow to firmly conclude on the insular origin of seizures, since they might as well follow the primary involvement of noninsular portions of a larger epileptogenic network where the seizure onset zone can keep clinically silent.64 Thus, apart from the situation where a clear-cut epileptogenic MRI lesion, such as a cavernous angioma or a low grade tumor, is observed within the insula, invasive EEG investigations, based on clinical observation of ictal symptomatology, must be targeted to explore the whole extent of the suspected epileptogenic network in order to assess the exact role of the insula in seizure development. Three major types of epileptogenic networks involving the insula can be distinguished:  

Temporo-perisylvian-insular networks that include the various brain regions bordering the sylvian fissure, i.e., the frontal, parietal and temporal operculum, together with the insula;   
Temporo-limbic-insular networks, which primarily involve the mesial temporal structures and/or the temporal pole;   
Mesial and orbito frontal-insular networks, in the context of the so-called nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy.  

This subdivision remains partly artificial, however, since some patients combine electro-clinical features that belong to at least two of these networks, as detailed below.  

#### Temporo-perisylvian-insular networks  

The concept of ‘perisylvian epilepsy’ was originally introduced by Munari et al.,50 in an attempt to distinguish this form of epilepsy from temporal lobe epilepsy proper. It should be noted, however, that in perisylvian the epileptogenic zone often encompasses the first temporal gyrus, accounting for the frequent presence of simple auditory hallucinations in this form of epilepsy, and explaining why the term ‘temporo-perisylvian’ is preferable to that of ‘perisylvian’. Apart from simple auditory hallucinations, temporo-perisylvian seizures are characterized by the presence of symptoms reflecting the involvement of the frontal and parietal operculum (hemifacial motor or somato-sensory symptoms, gustatory hallucinations, hypersalivation), the secondary somato-sensory area (various types of ipsilateral, contralateral or bilateral somatosensory symptoms), and the temporo-perisylvian vestibular cortex (vertigo).61  

Part of the semiology initially ascribed to frontal or parietal opercular ictal discharges in the early study of Munari et al.,50 which did not benefit from the placement of depth electrodes within the insula, does in fact reflect the involvement of the insular cortex. One such example is that of gustatory hallucinations, previously thought to reflect a fronto-parietal opercular discharge,52 but that can be elicited by stimulating the insula rather than the opercular region.17 Furthermore, both the insular cortex and parietal opercular somato-sensory (SII) cortex can be responsible for similar ictal somato-sensory symptoms affecting large cutaneous territories, even though the somatotopic fields are much larger in the insula than in $\mathrm{SII}^{65}$ Finally, the tight anatomical connections and cytoarchitectonic continuum observed between the fronto-parietal and temporal perisylvian cortex on one hand, and the insula on the other, also militates for including all these brain regions within the temporo-perisylvian network that must be explored by SEEG recordings before surgery. For instance, in two of the patients presented in section II ( $\#4$ and $\#5$ ), one of whom presented with a parietal cortical dysplasia $(\#4)$ , the SEEG involvement of part of the opercular regions was judged important enough to lead to a surgical resection or a thermolesion of that structure together with the posterior insula, resulting in seizure control in both patients (class Ib of Engel).  

In another recent series,66 the role of the insula in a temporo-perisylvian epileptogenic network can be suspected in six patients in whom temporal lobe surgery was unsuccessful in controlling seizures despite intracranial EEG evidence that the temporal lobe participated in seizures genesis. In these patients a somato-sensory aura was interpreted as reflecting a discharge in the parietal lobe and the inferior parietal region was indeed also involved at ictal onset on intracranial EEG recordings, but its secondary removal did not result in better seizure control. The authors acknowledged that the insula might have participated to the complex epileptogenic network observed in their patients, inasmuch as one presented with an insular hyperperfusion on ictal SPECT. They could not confirm this hypothesis, however, due to the lack of intracerebral electrodes directly placed within the insula.  

#### Temporo-limbic-insular networks  

One major challenge in epilepsy surgery remains to understand the origin of postoperative seizure recurrence in a still significant proportion of operated patients, despite the presence of typical clinical and MRI features of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Part of these surgical failures might reflect the involvement of the insular cortex within a larger epileptogenic network encompassing the sclerotic mesial temporal structures.67 This issue is well illustrated by patient $\#6$ in Figure 39.1, whose history has been further detailed in a recent review.68 Indeed, this patient fulfilled the major criteria used to define mTLE, including a rising and distressing epigastric sensation at seizure onset rapidly followed by oroalimentary automatisms, MRI signs of unilateral hippocampal sclerosis; ipsilateral temporo-limbic interictal FDG-PET hypometabolism, and an anterior temporal scalp-EEG ictal discharge. However, other ictal signs and symptoms suggested a rapid involvement of the perisylvian region, including early simple auditory hallucination and rapid occurrence of mastication and left face tonic contraction, leading to the decision of performing an invasive SEEG monitoring. The latter revealed that the patient suffered two seizure types, one arising from the sclerotic mesial temporal structures that secondarily propagated to the ipsilateral insula and opercular regions, and another arising from the posterior insula before invading the ipsilateral mesial temporal and opercular regions. Interestingly, the insular seizure type, but not that arising from the temporal lobe, selectively occurred during sleep. Resection of the epileptogenic temporal lobe controlled daytime seizures type for a few months only, whereas nocturnal seizures have continued unchanged. Overall, this case report illustrates the possibility of observing insular seizures in a patient with the major clinical and MRI features of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, suggesting an epileptogenic zone encompassing the temporo-limbic regions and the insula. This patient also demonstrated an intense and rapid involvement of other temporo-perisylvian regions, suggesting that these different networks might be intermingled and overlapping in the same patient.  

Other patients might present with comparable ictal semiology, EEG and neuroimaging data, and will eventually prove to have an epileptogenic zone limited to the temporo-limbic cortex. This alternative situation is illustrated by another patient from our series ( $\#2$ in Figure 39.1) whose intracerebral EEG recordings demonstrated a mesial temporal ictal discharge that invaded the insula very rapidly and intensively, suggesting that the insular cortex might be part of the epileptogenic zone.69 However, long-term seizure freedom was achieved after an anterior temporal lobectomy. More generally, seizures originating in the mesial temporal lobe are likely to propagate to the ipsilateral insula, though less rapidly and intensively than in the above patient, and this propagation70 does not preclude seizure freedom after temporal lobectomy.  

Several issues remained unsolved regarding the connections involved in the propagation of ictal discharges between the temporo-limbic system and the insula. Due to the frequent participation of the temporal pole at ictal onset,71 we prefer using the terminology ‘temporo-limbic’ rather than ‘mesial temporal’, knowing that part of this brain region is located outside the mesial aspect of the temporal lobe and is closely connected to the insula.  

In fact, according to Mesulam’s description of the paralimbic regions, two major belts should be considered, one including the orbito-frontal cortex, the temporal pole, and the insula, while the parahippocampal and cingulate gyrus form the other.33 Indeed, as already discussed, the insula has strong reciprocal connections with the temporal pole, but also with the entorhinal cortex and the amygdala. In addition, it projects to the anterior hippocampus but does not receive major direct afferents from this structure. It is yet unclear which of the above regions is predominantly involved in the insular propagation of temporo-limbic ictal discharge. Conversely, the posterior and anterior-inferior aspects of the insular cortex are predominantly involved in seizures propagating to the mesial temporal structures.68, 69  

#### Mesial and orbital frontal-insular networks  

A recent issue concerns the role of the insula as a part of the epileptogenic network in fontal lobe epilepsies and, more precisely, in NFLE, which is is primarily characterized by seizures occurring exclusively or predominantly during sleep, the semiology of which suggests a frontal lobe origin, as for example nocturnal paroxysmal dystonia (NPD) or hypermotor seizures.72 An autosomal dominant inheritance (ADNFLE) is found in $8{-}43\%$ of patients, and several mutated genes have been identified.72–76 However, many uncertainties persist regarding the neural networks underlying the cryptogenic and idiopathic forms of NFLE, inasmuch as very few patients have been investigated with intracranial EEG recordings.77, 78  

We have recently reported three patients with a typical form of nocturnal hypermotor seizures suggesting cryptogenic NFLE in two, and autosomal dominant NFLE (ADNFLE) in another, whose ictal onset zone proved located in the anterosuperior portion of the insula.79 In the two patients presenting with a seemingly cryptogenic NFLE, intracerebral EEG recordings demonstrated a very focal interictal focus in that same region, consisting of frequent bursts of high frequency discharges and high amplitude spikes (Figure 39.4). In the ADNFLE patient, the epileptogenic zone appeared larger, extending to the frontal operculum.  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/75aecc13-d94b-498f-a57b-d2c2317b2c13/3ba85c09e66991f0776df3b25be056860f67c6337737962dfc61b6c1a755f338.jpg)  
Figure 39.4 Intra-cerebral EEG investigation of a patient with a clinically-defined cryptogenic nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy showing almost permanent high amplitude spikes (left EEG traces), and a high frequency discharge at ictal onset (right EEG traces) in the antero-superior portion of the left insula (i1,i2), slightly diffusing to the nearby deepest aspect of the frontal operculum (i3–4), but not to more lateral probes. Note that all leads are displayed with a similar amplification.  

High frequency electrical stimulation of the antero-superior portion of the insula, but of no other region, could elicit a typical aura or full-blown seizure in two patients. However, because none of the three patients underwent epilepsy surgery, we cannot firmly conclude on the precise extent of their epileptogenic zone. Interestingly, these three patients represent $30\%$ of all those with nocturnal hypermotor seizures and no MRI brain lesion who underwent an intracerebral EEG investigation in our study. Among the seven other patients, a mesial or anterior frontal seizure onset was demonstrated and resected, but three continued to suffer postoperative seizures. One might speculate on the role of the insula in these patients seizures, provided that it was not investigated during their intracerebral EEG recordings.  

Overall, an insular seizure onset zone might be responsible for a significant proportion of so-called cryptogenic NFLE, at least among those resistant to antiepileptic drugs. At the present time, no clear indicator other than intracerebral EEG recordings allows to distinguish these patients from those presenting NFLE proper. In fact, our patients with an anterosuperior insular ictal onset started their hyperkinetic behavior only when the mesial frontal cortex was invaded.  

The propensity for insular seizure to occur during sleep has not been previously reported. However, it is interesting to note that this propensity was also observed in one of our patient with temporo-insular epilepsy (see previous section). The role of the insula in sleep physiology is not known, but recent functional neuroimaging studies have shown a marked deactivation of the anterior insula during sleep.80, 81  

Overall, insular seizures might be associated with various types of ictal semiology, reflecting the subregion of the insular cortex primarily affected, as well as the related multilobar network: the posterior and antero-inferior aspect of the insula appears to be mostly involved in temporo-perisylvian and/or insulo-temporo-limbic epileptogenic networks mimicking the different forms of TLE; the antero-superior portion of the insula seems to play a more important role in the insulo-frontal networks mimicking NFLE. At the present time, there is no available data suggesting a primary role of the insular cortex in seizures originating from other brain areas than those listed above.  

## Etiology of insular epilepsy  

### Lesional insular epilepsy  

The majority of cases reported in the literature as insular seizures or epilepsies derives from patients with an obvious epileptogenic brain lesion located in the insula, some of which were subsequently and successfully operated upon. 41,42,54, 69, 82,–85 These lesions primarily included low grade brain tumors, including gliomas and dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors, cavernomas, and cortical dysplasia. However, all potentially epileptogenic brain lesions might be observed in the insula, such as stroke or encephalitis.86, 87  

### Cryptogenic and idiopathic epilepsy primarily involving the insula  

To our knowledge, the only published cases of cryptogenic epilepsy primarily involving the insula are those published by our group.68,69 They represent a very limited number of patients, none of whom underwent a surgical resection of their epileptogenic but MRI negative insula. No pathological data is thus available, but SEEG findings suggested the possibility of a MRI occult cortical dysplasia in a minority of patients. For instance, one of our patients with NFLE of insular origin presented an intracerebral SEEG pattern typical of an underlying cortical dysplasia, with very focal and permanent high amplitude spikes intermingled with bursts of high frequency discharges (Figure 39.4).79 In the same series, one who presented with a typical form of ADNFLE, but none of the known mutation of the $\propto4$ and $\upbeta2$ subunits of the nicotinic acetyl-choline receptor, should be considered to suffer an idiopathic form of partial insulo-opercular epilepsy, according to the familial inheritance of his epileptic disorder and the result of his SEEG investigation.79,88 To our knowledge, no other patient with ADNFLE has undergone an intracerebral EEG investigation, and we therefore ignore the proportion of such patients who might also demonstrate an insular epileptogenic zone.  

## Presurgical evaluation  

### Noninvasive investigations  

#### EEG and MEG  

According to the deep location and specific gyral organisation of the insula, interictal or ictal epileptiform discharges originating in this lobe are unlikely to be detected by scalp-EEG recording, unless these discharges propagate to lateral neocortical regions. This has been shown in our first description of insular discharges70 and is also illustrated by Figure 39.4. Accordingly, neither interictal nor ictal scalp-EEG abnormality could be recorded in this patient, accounting for the fact that the epileptic origin of his seizure disorder has been strongly debated.  

However, scalp-EEG recordings might provide some clue regarding a temporo-perisylvian epileptogenic zone, indirectly reflecting the potential involvement of the insular cortex. In particular, both interictal and ictal EEG abnormalities will display a more widespread distribution over the infra- and suprasylvian elecrodes.  

To our knowledge, a single case report has assessed the diagnostic value of MEG in a patient with an insular epileptogenic DNET, and concluded that MEG could detect epileptiform abnormalities within the concealed insular cortex.82  

#### Functional interictal neuroimaging  

In patients with typical TLE, $\big[}{}^{18}\mathrm{F}\big]$ FDG-PET and $\big[\mathrm{}^{11}\mathrm{C}\big]$ Flumazenil-PET studies have reported that interictal hypometabolism and decreased benzodiazepine receptor density observed in the temporal lobe could extend to the insula in some patients.89–92 At the present time, the presence of such insular abnormalities have not been clearly associated with a higher risk of postoperative seizure relapse, but this issue still needs to be addressed in larger populations.  

In the few well-documented cases of insular epilepsy, ${\big[}{}^{18}{\mathrm{F}}{\big]}$ FDG-PET, $\big[\mathrm{^{11}C}\big]$ Flumazenil-PET, and ictal SPECT did not demonstrate distinctive features from those encountered in TLE or NFLE, and in particular no clear cut insular abnormality.67,68  

Finally, $\big[{}^{18}\mathrm{F}\big]$ FDG-PET and ictal SPECT have shown abnormal findings in the insula of a few patients with uncertain epileptogenic zone, where one might speculate on the involvement of the insula.66,93,94 These include patients with nocturnal hypermotor seizures,93,94 as well as one patient with somato-sensory aura and a seemingly temporo-parietal ictal onset zone not controlled by surgery sparing the insula.66  

Overall, whether functional imaging will eventually prove useful in the clinical assessment of insular epilepsy remains an open issue.  

### Invasive investigations  

In the stereotactic implantation technique first described by Talairach and Bancaud,95 intracerebral electrodes are implanted perpendicular to the midsagittal plane using Talairach’s stereotactic grid and can be left in place chronically up to 15 days.96 The position of each contact can be plotted on the corresponding slice of the atlas of Talairach and Tournoux97 and by fusing the frontal skull radiography with the coronal MRI slice, both at scale 1/1, corresponding to the electrode trajectory (Figure 39.3a). Oblique electrode trajectories can be also useful to explore the insula.79  

#### Interictal insular recordings  

The few available data from literature on interictal insular paroxysmal activities in surface or depth recordings were reported in the fifties.36, 98, 99 These early studies showed that spikes or spike-waves are recorded in the insula of nearly $50\%$ of TLE patients. In SEEG recordings they are present in all patients with insular seizures. They are sporadic or intermittent in TLE and most often frequent in patients with insular seizures, particularly in those with focal dysplasia.91 Since the early study of Silfvenius et al.39 it has been acknowledged that their presence is not predictive of a poor outcome of temporal lobectomy in TLE, so that they do not indicate an insular epileptogenic zone. Spikes in the amygdala, hippocampus or temporal pole usually co-exist, and are most often asynchronous, with insular paroxysms. Contacts located in supra- or infrasylvian opercular cortex or adjacent amygdalo-hippocampal structures are often blind to insular paroxysms, which are thus unlikely to be recordable by subdural electrodes grids placed over the sylvian fissure or on the mesial surface of the temporal lobe (Figure 39.5).

#### Ictal insular SEEG recordings  

In terms of onset site, propagation and morphology, the insular discharge patterns are very similar from one seizure to the other in a given patient, suggesting an individual organization of the insular epileptogenic neuronal network. They are made of a low voltage fast activity (LvFA) that may begin abruptly, or be preceded by changes in interictal activity. These preictal changes manifest by an increase in the frequency of spikes that become more regular or rhythmic and/or by the appearance of spikes and poly-spike-waves. Ictal LvFA can remain confined in the insula during several tens of seconds, or spread outside the insula in a few hundreds of milliseconds. During their intrainsular development LvFAs are not detectable by SEEG contacts located in neighbouring structures, in particular in the temporo-parieto-frontal opercular cortex, the activity of which is either unchanged or shows only rhythmic slow waves without sharp paroxysms during insular LvFA discharges (Figure 39.6).  

We have never observed an insular LvFA not spreading, either step by step to perisylvian cortical areas, or more abruptly at distance to ipsilateral amygdala, hippocampus or posterior mesial frontal cortex. Lastly, in two patients with a bilateral SEEG exploration we could observe that an insular LvFA can propagate to the contralateral insula. This anecdotal observation does not allow any conclusion as to the frequency of insular seizures bilateralization, but suggests that the insula is not only a possible relay for intrahemispheric propagation of focal seizures (see section III), but also a route for their interhemispheric transfer.  

## Treatment  

Based on electrocorticography, insular resections were attempted as early as the late forties to improve the surgical outcome of temporal lobectomy.36,39,98,99 This procedure has been abandoned because it proved to have a much greater morbidity than the usual temporal lobectomy alone without improving significantly the seizure control. Progress in surgical techniques now allows, with an acceptable risk level, the removal of focal epileptogenic lesions located in the insula, such as tumors42 and cavernous angiomas.100,101 The outcome in terms of seizures control is usually good,102 so that a lesionnectomy can be proposed, without presurgical invasive EEG recordings, whenever an insular lesion manifests clinically by seizures with insular ictal symptomatology, as in the case illustrated in Figure 39.2.  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/75aecc13-d94b-498f-a57b-d2c2317b2c13/8e670fc12f2a49328f7bd35c4efa74ac6ad727d80cd318bd35ed95d4e3c88fbe.jpg)  
Figure 39.7 Sagittal (1), coronal (2) and axial (3) control brain MR images after insular radio frequency thermo lesions using the SEEG electrodes contacts implanted in the epileptogenic areas of patient 5. This procedure was performed immediately before SEEG electrodes removal and thus did not entail the risk of additional electrodes implantation. These RM images acquired 15 days after this procedure show the thermo-lesions located at the insular onset site of seizures (A), and in the parietal opercular cortex (B), which was the first propagation relay of insular discharges.  

Partial or subtotal resection of the insular cortex is also feasible in a patient without a space-occupying lesion (case 4 in Figure 39.1). However, this remains an aggressive procedure that necessitates the removal of part of the opercular parietofrontal or temporal cortex, and entails a lesional risk in the deep territory of the middle cerebral artery. In the absence of a lesion no tailored insular cortectomy can be undertaken without presurgical SEEG exploration of the entire cortical network suspected as epileptogenic (see the third main section), with recordings of several spontaneous seizures and insular stimulations.  

An alternative to cortectomy is represented by SEEG guided radio-frequency (RF) thermocoagulation.71 RF thermocoagulation is performed using adjacent contacts of SEEG electrodes in sites where discharges have been recorded. It produces focal lesions of $5{-}7~\mathrm{mm}$ diameter with minimal risk (Figure 39.7). Two of the eight patients reported in this chapter (see the second main section) have benefited from RF thermocoagulation ( $\yen5$ and 8), with a follow up of 36 and 17 months, respectively. Both are free of disabling seizures (class Ib of Engel).

# 40 Cingulate epilepsy  

## Introduction  

Between the 1940s and 1950s, studies on experimental animals and observations on human beings with destructive lesions led to the discovery of a possible relationship between the anterior portion of the cingulate gyrus (CG) and behavioral disorders. Those studies also led to the use of surgical ablation of the anterior portion of the CG or of cingulum disconnection for the treatment of severe behavioral illnesses. Many advances have been made in the last 20 years and, even if a clear understanding of all its connections and functions is still far in the future, the CG has been shown to be, indeed, a heterogeneous structure.  

Because of peculiarities of its vascular irrigation (the pericallosal artery and its branches irrigate the medial portion of the frontal lobe and part of the medial portion of the parietal lobe), ischemic or hemorrhagic lesions circumscribed to the CG are rare. Small tumors or malformative lesions relatively restricted to the CG are also uncommon. These facts limit our ability to study CG function based on lesional observations.  

Noninvasive neurophysiological studies provide only partial or inconclusive data because of the anatomical location of the CG (medial and distant from the cerebral surface, with significant portion of the CG buried in the depths of the pericallosal and cingulate sulci). This makes it difficult to define the ictal clinical manifestations of the CG as a symptomatogenic zone.  

The objective of the present chapter is to describe the clinical characteristics of epileptic seizures most probably originating in the CG. As an introduction a brief review of the cytoarchitecture, connections and functions of the CG of humans and experimental animals will be presented.  

### Cytoarchiteture  

Brodmann’s cytoarchitectural map of the cerebral cortex has been used as the standard for human brain research. The CG is divided into anterior and posterior parts (Figure 40.1). The anterior part consists of the perigenual portion, areas 25 and 33, and of the midcingulate portion, areas 24 and 32. The posterior cingulate consists of the posterior cingulate cortex, areas 23 and 31, of the retrosplenial portion, areas 29 and 30, and the ectosplenial portion, area 26. Areas 29, 30, and 26 are narrow and located in the isthmus of the CG.1  

More recent cytoarchitecture studies have confirmed that an important part of the CG cortex is buried in the depth of the sulci (Figure 40.1). The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)  

is agranular, with a prominent Va layer. Not all the cortex of area 24 is exposed on the surface2 and histological differences exist between the caudal and rostral parts of area 24, which is, therefore, subdivided into 24a, 24b, 24c, and 24d.3 The main difference resides in the composition and thickness of layers Va and Vb.3 Area 24c lies primarily within the ventral bank of the cingulate sulcus.2 This area is called the cingulate motor cortex, since pyramidal Betz cells have been demonstrated in layer Va.4 Compared with the Betz cells of the primary motor field, those of the cingulate area display numerous primitive traits.5  

In non-human primates, in addition to cytoarchitectural differences there are differences in inputs. While the rostral portion of area 24 receives substantial input from the amygdala, the caudal portion receives a large component of parietal lobe afferents.6  

The posterior CG consists of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), areas 23 and 31, and the retrosplenial and ectosplenial areas 29, 30, and 26. Areas 29, 30, and 26 are buried in the depths of the pericallosal sulcus. Area 23 is located in the caudal portion of the CG and extends into the caudal part of the cingulate sulcus before it arches to form the marginal sulcus. The PCC is characterized by granular layers II and IV,2 except for area 30 whose layer IV is dysgranular.7  

Area 23 is subdivided into 23a, 23b, 23c, and 23d as a function of the degree of differentiation of layer III and of the size and distribution of neurons of layers IV and Va.3  

### Connections  

The cingulate cortex is considered to be part of the limbic system and is also a component of the Papez circuit. Outputs from the amygdala, septal area, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus travel via the fornix to the mammillary bodies of the hypothalamus; from there via the mammillothalamic tract, to the anterior thalamic nucleus (anteroventral subdivision); and via the thalamocortical fiber system to the CG, and then back to the hippocampus via the cingulum and entorhinal areas. This closed circuit of connections was described by Papez8 and became known as the Papez circuit.  

Studies in rhesus monkeys using retrograde tracer horseradish peroxidase have shown that both the ACC and the PCC receive thalamic inputs. Although each area of the CG receives inputs from distinct thalamic nuclei, the anterior thalamic nucleus (anteromedial subdivision) sends afferent fibers to areas 25, 24, and 23, thus forming a certain connectional link between all cingulate areas.9

Figure 40.1 Cingulate gyrus cytoarchitectural areas. Areas 24, 25, 23, and 31 are located on the mesial surface. Small portions of areas 24 and 23 are buried in the depth of the cingulate sulci. Areas 32, 33, 26, 29, and 30 are buried in the depth of the cingulate and pericallosal sulcus $\mathrm{ACG}=$ anterior cingulate gyrus; $\mathsf{P C G}=$ posterior cingulate gyrus; ${\mathrm{CC}}=$ corpus callosum; $\mathrm{CS}=$ cingulate sulcus, $\mathsf{M R}\overset{=}{=}$ marginal ramus)  

The ACC and PCC also receive a large contingent of afferents from the frontal lobe, especially the dorsolateral and orbital areas, and also from the parietal lobe. Most of the frontal cortical afferents reach area 24, whereas area 23 preferentially receives inputs from the parietal lobe.6 The ACC also receives afferents from the insula cortex and the PCC receives a small proportion of afferents from the occipital lobe, area 19.6  

The CG also has extensive efferents connections. Studies on rhesus monkeys have shown that areas 23 and 24 have extensive and widespread projections to several regions of the cerebral cortex (Figure 40.2). Area 24 projects to the premotor region (areas 6 and 8), the orbito-frontal cortex (area 12), the rostral part of the inferior parietal lobe, the anterior insular cortex, the perirhinal cortex, and the laterobasal nucleus of the amygdala. Area 23, likewise, sends its connections to the dorsal prefrontal cortex (areas 9 and 10), the rostral orbital cortex (area 11), the parietotemporal cortex (posterior part of the inferior parietal lobule and the superior temporal sulcus), the parahippocampal gyrus, the retrosplenial region, and the presubiculum.10  

The anterior cingulate cortex also sends projections to brainstem motor systems including the caudate, pontine, and red nuclei.11,12  

### Functions  

Structural lesions, surgical ablations, or functional alterations due to electrical stimulation of the CG in animals and humans shed some light on the function of the CG. These studies have been complemented by microelectrode recordings, and positron emission tomography in experimental animals and human beings.  

Changes in behavior can occur due to lesions in area 24, although in many of these reports on humans and experimental animals additional damage was also evident in the adjacent areas 6, 8, 9, 10, and 25 and in the corpus callosum.  

In monkeys, ablation of area 24 was marked by increased restlessness, hyperactivity, loss of their previous apprehension to certain aspects of their environment, apparent loss of fear, increased tameness, and reduction of aggression.13 In animals with a longer survival time these changes tend to be reduced or to disappear.

Figure 40.2 Cingulate gyrus simplified sketch showing efferent connections from areas 23 and 24 in  the monkey’s brain ( $\mathrm{CC}\ =$ corpus callosum; ${\mathrm{CG}}\ =$ cingulate gyrus; ${\mathsf{P H G}}=$ parahippocampal gyrus; ${\mathsf{P S}}=$ presubiculum; ${\mathsf{R S}}=$ retrosplenial area; $\dot{\mathsf{S}}\dot{\mathsf{T}}\mathsf{G}=$ superior temporal gyrus).  

Behavioral changes such as indifference, docility, inappropriate urination, severe lack of attention, lack of social restraint, heightened sexuality, bulimia, and aggressiveness have also been reported to occur in humans as a consequence of unilateral14 or bilateral15 lesions in the anterior portion of the CG.  

Bilateral lesions of area 24 also cause the so-called anterior cingulate gyri syndrome which clinically manifests as apathy, akinesia, mutism, urinary incontinence, and indifference to pain.16  

Structural lesions and studies of cortical stimulation have also correlated the anterior cingulate with autonomic phenomena such as piloerection,13 changes in blood pressure, tachycardia, mydriasis, and increased respiration frequency.17,18,19 The structural basis for involvement of area 25 in visceromotor activity is well known. Area 25 projects directly to the parasympathetic nucleus of the solitary tract,20 dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and to the sympathetic thoracic intermediolateral cell column.21  

The anterior cingulate is also involved in the emotional aspects of pain perception.22,23  

The ability of the anterior cingulate to participate in or execute motor functions has been studied extensively. The presence of Betz cells in area 24 supports the hypothesis of the possible existence of a motor area in the CG. In experimental animals the lower bank of the anterior cingulate sulcus is involved in self-initiated movements.24 There is also evidence that areas 24c and $23\mathsf{c}$ send inputs to the motor and supplementary motor cortices in a somatotopic distribution.25  

Additionally, there are reports that cortical stimulation of the ACC evokes motor responses in man.26–29 The nature of the responses obtained differ among the various studies, but include repetitive movements of the hands, fingers, and lips that can be classified as automatisms, tonic contractions involving the hands and arms, or an irresistible urge to grasp something.  

The posterior CG probably integrates visual information recognized in the visual cortex and an emotion-related substrate is processed in the anterior cingulate.30  

Electrical activity of PCC is detected during eye movements in several species while assessing large visual field patterns. The activity is linked to the position of the eye in the orbit and the direction and amplitude of saccadic eye movements.31–33 Several observations have suggested that the PCC contributes to orientation of the animal in the environment and to spatial memory. Lesions of the posterior cingulate disrupt a rat’s ability to swim to a hidden platform.34 The observation of the deficits due to lesion of the retrosplenial region of rats has led to the assumption that the damage may disrupt the integration and transmission of both movement-related information and visuospatial information from cortex to hippocampal formation. The hypothesis is that the retrosplenial region is important not for memory of landmarks or other visuospatial cues, but rather the functional role of this region may be to purposefully organize the movements with respect to surrounding visual landmarks.35  

## Cingulate seizures  

### Overview  

The semiologic characterization of epileptic seizures originating in the CG cortex is a challenge in epileptology. As mentioned before, the anatomical location of the CG makes neurophysiological studies with scalp electrodes difficult. Similar problems are encountered with invasive neurophysiological recordings. The presence of large caliber blood vessels on the medial surface of the brain and the fact that a considerable proportion of the cortex is located inside sulci make invasive evaluation of this area difficult.  

Ideal cases for the study of ictal clinical manifestations would be small medial epileptogenic lesions practically limited to the CG. These cases are relatively rare and literature data are limited to case reports or relatively small series. Thus, the semiologic aspects of the epileptic seizures of this region are still poorly defined. Most cases in the literature do not provide direct evidence that the epileptogenic zone was in the CG or actually limited to the CG. The gold standard would be cases in which a resection of an epileptogenic zone limited to the CG renders the patient free. Such cases do not exist in the current literature. Therefore, the following review of the literature refers to cases in which the lesion was mainly in the CG, even if there was no direct proof that the seizures originated from the CG, i.e., patients were not necessarily seizure free after surgery and/or the surgery was not limited to the cingulated gyrus.  

Although auras are considered rare,36 autonomic symptoms such as tachycardia, mydriasis, and changes in respiratory frequency are considerate common.37 Other descriptions are sensation of fear, dizziness,37 and painful sensations.38  

In general, reports in the literature tend to stress that seizures originating from the cingualte gyrus are frequent, brief, nocturnal and do not include significant preictal or postictal alterations.36  

The ictal semiology that has been related to the anterior cingulate is relatively varied. Some ictal manifestations like complex automatisms, laughter, and altered level of attention or consciousness have been described more frequently.  

Table 40.1 summarizes literature cases with seizures originating in the anterior portion of the cingulate, as confirmed by scalp video-EEG evaluation and/or invasive recording in lesional and non-lesional cases. Complex gestural movements,36–40 laughter,36,38,39,41 tonic contraction,36 lapses of attention, blinking, and oroalimentary automatism40 were the most common clinical manifestations.  

For comparative purposes, on the basis of described data, we reclassified the seizures according to the semiological seizure classification (Table 40.1).42 The most frequent types of epileptic seizures reported as originating from the anterior portion of the CG were bilateral asymmetric tonic seizures, gelastic seizures, hypermotor seizures, and complex motor seizures. In two cases the seizures were preceded by a somatosensory and autonomic aura respectively. In one case an autonomic seizure was documented (mydriasis).  

Dialeptic seizures were reported in only one report. This patient by history had atonic and complex motor seizures, but dialeptic seizures were documented during evaluation by video-EEG.40  

Stimulation with depth electrodes have shown that continuous movements may be elicited by electrical stimulation of the anterior region of the CG. These movements were classified as automatisms and primarily involved the fingers, hands, lips, and tongue. The movements were ‘primitive’ and simple such as touching, leaning, rubbing, stretching, or sucking. The movements were frequently integrated with more complex movements that were adapted to the situation and thus represent, as a whole, what the authors called ‘types of behavior’.19,26  

#### Cleveland clinic series  

In an attempt to better define the semiology of seizures originating from the CG, we reviewed the Cleveland Clinic Epilepsy database. To analyze the semiology and the electroencephalographic findings of seizures originating from the CG, patients of any age range evaluated by video-EEG and with symptomatic focal epilepsy secondary to a single structural lesion identifiable by magnetic resonance and localized in the CG, anterior, or posterior region were selected. No attempt was made here to define if the observed ictal semiology was due to direct activation of the CG (symptomatogenic zone in the CG) or due to spread an activation of extra-CG symptomatogenic areas such as, for example, the adjacent supplementary sensory-motor area.  

Only cases in which at least $90\%$ of the lesion was located in the CG were included. Patients with extensive lesions with a small proportion in the CG or with extensive lesions widely involving the CG and adjacent regions as also non-lesional cases were excluded.  

Of patients evaluated between 1990 and 2005 who had received a diagnosis or a diagnosis of probable cingulate epilepsy, 76 were selected. The clinical data and the neuroimaging exams were reviewed. Only eight of 76 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria listed above.

To correlate the semiologic data with the location of the lesion, sagittal sections of MRI were selected and the best section for the visualization of the anterior and posterior commissures and of the structural lesion was chosen for each individual. The horizontal plane, anterior commissureposterior commissure line (AC-PC) and the vertical anterior commissure line (VAC) and the vertical posterior commissure line (VPC) of the vertical plane of the Talairach and Tournoux43 coordinates were traced.  

The CG was thus divided into three portions: anterior, middle, and posterior. The anterior portion is located rostral to the VAC line, the middle portion is caudal in relation to the VAC line and rostral in relation to the VPC line, and finally the posterior portion is caudal in relation to the VPC line.  

The lesion was then carefully identified on the three magnetic resonance planes – sagittal, coronal and axial – and their rostrocaudal and ventrodorsal extension was represented on a map on the sagittal plane.  

Considering the cytoarchitectural data, area 24 occupies a large part of the anterior and middle portion (Figure 40.1), so the anterior and middle portions of the CG were considered to be anterior cingulate.  

According to the location of the structural lesion, the cases were divided into anterior CG lesion group (ACGL-group) when the lesions were located in the anterior cingulate (the entire extension rostral to the VPC line) and posterior CG lesion group (PCGL-group) when the lesions were located in the posterior cingulate (caudal portion in relation to the VPC line).  

Clinical data such as age at the onset of seizures, semiologic description provided by the patients and their relatives and complaints of behavioral changes, seizures recorded during video-EEG monitoring, and interictal and ictal recordings were reviewed. Wieser et al.’s classification of outcome following epilepsy surgery was used for the classification of surgical outcome.44  

#### Demographic data  

Of the eight patients, six were males and two were females. Age ranged from 8–52 years, with a mean of 23.7 years. Five of the eight patients were 14 years old or younger. Age at the onset of seizures ranged from 7–44 years, with a mean of 18.2 years. Three patients had a recent history of onset of seizures ( $\cdot<1$ year) and the interval between the onset of seizures and evaluation ranged from 0–22 years, with a mean of 4.7 years (Table 40.2).  

All patients had a normal neurological examination and seven had normal intelligence; only one was in the mentally deficient range.  

Four patients (1, 2, 3, and 4) had anterior CG lesions (ACGL-group), and four (5, 6, 7, and 8) had posterior CG lesions (PCGL-group) (Figure 40.3).  

The results of the anatomopathological analysis of the seven patients who had surgery were low grade astrocytoma in five cases, reactive astrocytosis in one case, and ganglioglioma in one case.  

Four of the eight patients reported mood changes, depression, and reduced school performance. Of these four, only one belonged to the ACGL-group, while the remaining ones belonged to the PCGL-group. The data obtained by psychiatric evaluation or using the back depression inventory are presented in Table 40.2. The patient from the ACGL-group had adjustment disorder with depressed mood. Only one of the three patients from the PCGL-group had a more severe psychiatric disorder (major depressive episodes and reduced school performance). The remaining two patients of the PCGL-group had affective distress and emotional distress with mild to moderate feeling of depression, respectively.  

#### Seizure characteristics  

The ictal semiology data obtained from the clinical history were provided by patients and relatives and are listed in Table 40.2.  

All patients presented frequent – daily or weekly – seizures. Only patient 1 (ACGL-group) had a lower frequency of seizures – one to four seizures per month.  

By history, the seizures’ duration varied from seconds to minutes in both groups. The most prolonged seizures reported lasted about 2–3 minutes, namely patients 1 and 2 from the ACGL-group and patients 5 and 8 from the PCGL-group. Shorter seizures lasting 10–20 seconds occurred in patient 3 from the ACGL-group and patient 6 from the PCGL-group  

#### Auras  

Five patients reported auras, two in the ACGL-group and three in the PCGL-group. The two patients in the ACGLgroup presented clinical manifestation lateralized contralateral to the structural lesion. One patient described pins and needles in the contralateral arm and the other complained of a heavy contralateral leg. The latter also reported a nonspecific complaint described as dizziness.  

The three patients in the PCGL-group who reported auras described them as tingling in both legs, and dizziness (patient 5), depersonalization feelings (patient 7) and abdominal sensations (patient 8).  

#### Semiologic analysis of the seizures by video-EEG examination  

Semiological seizure classification  

When auras were excluded and the initial presentation of the epileptic seizures was evaluated as documented in the videoEEG, the following types of seizures were observed: ACGLgroup: complex motor seizures, hypermotor seizures and bilateral asymmetric tonic seizures; PCGL-group: automotor seizures and dialeptic seizuress (Table 40.3).  

Analysis of the seizure evolution (Table 40.3) shows that all the patients, except for patient 6, showed a changing seizure manifestation. Regarding the motor manifestations, we shall first consider the initial pattern of the seizure and then the seizure evolution.  

#### Motor manifestations  

#### ACGL-group  

All four patients in the ACGL-group exhibited motor manifestations. In two patients the seizures were characterized by relatively complex movements that imitated natural movements involving different parts of the body (patients 1 and 2). In patient 2 the movements were more abrupt and ample and

predominantly involved the trunk. The initial seizure of patient 1 was classified as complex motor seizure and that of patient 2 as hypermotor seizure.  

The motor manifestations of the other two patients were characterized by bilateral and asymmetric tonic contractions mainly involving the upper limbs, i.e., bilateral asymmetric tonic seizure.  

The initial seizures progressed to clonic or focal tonic seizures contralateral to the structural lesion or to seizures with complex automatisms, i.e., complex motor seizures. In patient 1 the initial motor seizure evolved into a predominantly unresponsive phase (dialeptic seizure). In patient 2 the initial hypermotor seizure progressed to a focal tonic seizure involving the contralateral arm and the leg. Patient 3 progressed from a bilateral asymmetric tonic seizure to a contralateral clonic seizure involving the shoulder and the arm or the arm and the leg. Patient 4 progressed from a bilateral asymmetric tonic to complex motor seizure manifesting as complex movements of lower limbs, trunk and head.  

Patients 2 and 3 progressed to secondary generalization, which was tonic-clonic in both cases. Patient 2 presented relatively asymmetric clonic movements during the phase of clonic seizure. While the side contralateral to the lesion was more tonic, the ipsilateral half of the body, and mainly the upper limb, presented more evident clonic contractions.  

#### PCGL-group  

Of the four patients in this group, only three had seizures that were documented by video-EEG. Two of them had motor manifestations during the initial phase of the seizure, characterized by automatisms of the distal segments of the body, particularly the fingers and hands (patients 5 and 7). These automatisms were characteristic of automotor seizures.  

In patient 6, the seizure was characterized by impairment of consciousness, with minimal motor manifestations, i.e., a dialeptic seizure.  

No seizure was recorded for patient 8 but the clinical history revealed that his seizures consisted predominantly of impairment of consciousness, without clear motor manifestations (dialeptic seizure).  

The initial automotor or dialeptic seizures of this group progressed to contralateral focal clonic or versive seizures.  

Patient 5 progressed from automotor seizure to focal clonic seizure in four of eight recorded. automotor seizures. Of these four seizures, three manifested with clonic jerks involving the proximal portion of the contralateral upper limb, shoulder, and trunk. The upper limb exhibited clonic contractions simultaneous with elevation and abduction movements. In one seizure, the clonic contractions involved the trunk bilaterally and the proximal region of the arm ipsilateral to the side of lesion.  

Patient 7 progressed from automotor seizures to contralateral versive seizure.  

Two of the three patients in this group presented secondary generalization.  

Patient 5 presented a secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizure. The tonic seizure started in the arm contralateral to the side of lesion and this arm remained extended. The clonic phase also started in the contralateral arm and became generalized but asymmetric, predominating in the body half ipsilateral to the lesion. At the end of the generalized seizure, this patient presented a clonic seizure in the arm ipsilateral to the side of lesion (paradoxical clonic seizure) which lasted approximately 5 seconds.  

#### Other motor manifestations  

Other motor manifestations associated with the main seizure type described above were also observed. These motor manifestations consisted of head deviation ipsilateral to the side of lesion during a generalized clonic seizure (patient 3) or during an automotor seizure (patients 5, 7), grimacing during a hypermotor seizure and dialeptic seizure (patients 2, 6), looking around during a hypermotor seizure and dialeptic seizure (patients 2, 6), blinking during a bilateral asymmetric tonic seizure (patient 4), and grinning (patient 5) during an automotor seizure.  

#### Automatisms  

#### ACGL-group  

The automatisms of the patients in this group were predominantly characterized by complex movements involving the upper and lower limbs and the trunk. In patient 1 the automatisms involved the hands, head, trunk, and legs. The hands remained open with the palmar surface of the left hand on the dorsal surface of the right hand, with the fingers interlacing intermittently. Under the sheet, the legs exhibited ample and alternating movements at times with the right leg and at times with the left leg. He also showed body and head wiggling and lip-smacking. The automatisms of patient 2 were characteristic of hypermotor seizures and involved the trunk (he sat up in bed, flexed his trunk and alternately turned it to the right and to the left) and upper limbs (he grabbed the bed rails). In addition, he also exhibited a repetitive tremor-like movement of the right hand. Patient 4 presented tongue protrusion and wide movements of the lower limbs and trunk and balanced his head, alternately turning it to the right and to the left.

#### PCGL-group  

The automatisms of this group were characterized by more distal movements predominantly involving the hands. Patient 5 presented automatisms involving the hands bilaterally. The most frequent was smoothing the sheet that covered him with his open hand. The automatisms were also directed at nearby objects; for example, the patient handled the bracelet on his left hand while his left hand showed opening and closing movements. He also had scratching of the suprapubic region. Patient 6 sniffed several times during the seizure. In both seizures of patient 7 the automatisms involved the hand ipsilateral to the side of lesion. Holding the sheet between his thumb and fingers he made movements by rubbing the thumb and fingers together.  

#### Vocalization  

Excluding the vocalization typical of the beginning of secondary generalized seizures, only patients in the ACGL-group presented ictal vocalization. Patient 2 grunted and patients 3 and 4 moaned.  

#### Facial expression  

Changes in facial expression were more marked in patients 2 and 3 in the ACGL-group, who appeared to be scared. Patient 6 (PCGL-group) showed a discrete change in facial expression, looking more still and barely expressive.  

#### Level of consciousness  

Excluding the auras, in the ACGL-group, one patient presented total amnesia of all his seizures, two patients could remember some motor manifestations during the seizures, and one patient was very sleepy and poorly responsive after seizures recorded by video-EEG, although by history this patient was aware during his motor manifestations. In the PCGL-group, out of the three patients whose seizures were recorded, two had loss of consciousness and one had total amnesia of seizures.  

#### Autonomic phenomena  

Patient 1 presented tachycardia, with his basal heart rate of 60 reaching 120 during the seizure. On the basis of history data, patient 6 had mydriasis, which was not documented during the video-EEG.  

#### Duration of seizures  

In the ACGL-group the seizures without secondary generalization lasted 30–70 seconds, while those with secondary generalization lasted on average 90 seconds. In the PCGLgroup, the duration of seizures without generalization ranged from 25–80 seconds, while the duration of seizures with secondary generalization lasted about 85 seconds. Patient 3 only presented seizures with secondary generalization which lasted on average 85 seconds.  

#### Postictal manifestations  

Except for the seizures with secondary generalization, one patient in the ACGL-group presented a prolonged period of postictal confusion lasting as long as 20 minutes and another presented Todd paralysis involving the leg and arm contralateral to side of the lesion.  

#### Lateralizing signs  

Lateralizing signs were frequent both in the ACGL-group and in the PCGL-group. In five of the eight patients, it was possible to infer the side of the lesion on the basis of the clinical characteristics of the seizures.  

Of the four patients in the ACGL-group, two had focal tonic or clonic seizures involving the arm, leg, or shoulder contralateral to the side of structural lesion. One patient presented Todd paralysis involving the arm and leg contralateral to the lesion. On the basis of clinical history, in this group the auras were unilateral, involving the arm or leg also contralateral to the side of lesion.  

Of the four patients in the PCGL-group, one presented a focal clonic seizure contralateral to the lesion (shoulder and trunk) and one presented a versive seizure preceding secondary generalization, also contralateral to the side of lesion, and a paradoxical clonic seizure at the end of a seizure with secondary generalization.  

Relation of the seizures to the wakefulness-sleep cycle All patients in the ACGL-group had seizures during sleep.  

All the three patients in the PCGL-group with recorded seizures had seizures while awake, although one seizure occurred shortly after the awakening.  

#### Eletroencephalogaphic recording  

Interictal epileptiform findings  

Interictal epileptiform abnormalities were recorded in six of the eight cases $(75\%)$ . Among these six patients, the epileptiform discharges were exclusively ipsilateral to the side of lesion in three, independent bilateral in one but with a marked predominance $(85\%)$ also ipsilateral to the side of lesion, and on the vertex region in two (Table 40.3).  

Among the ACGL-group, only two patients showed epileptiform discharge, one regional temporal (bilateral, but mainly ipsilateral to the side of lesion) and one regional on the vertex region.  

All patients in the PCGL-group showed interictal epileptiform discharges, three regional on the temporal region (all of them ipsilateral to the side of lesion) and one regional at vertex.  

#### Ictal findings  

Among the seven patients with seizure recordings, the ictal EEG was regional in four, lateralized in one and nonlocalizable in two (Table 40.3).  

Among the seven cases with seizure recordings, the ictal EEG would predict correctly the side of lesion in only three patients.  

Regarding location, the ictal EEG was on the fronto-vertexparietal areas with or without clues for lateralization also in three of seven cases $(42.8\%)$ . In the remaining four cases, the ictal recording was non-localizable in two, lateralized and ipsilateral to the side of lesion in one and regional temporal and also ipsilateral to the lesion in the other.  

Although the number of patients was small, we observed that there seemed to be a greater difficulty in lateralization in the ACGL-group. Only one of the four patients presented an ictal recording over the centroparietal region with lateralizing data. In another patient the recording was over the midline with no evidence for lateralization, and the last two cases were non-localizable.  

Among the three patients in the PCL-group with ictal recording, the EEG was regional in two and lateralized in one. The regional ictal EEG was over the midline, involving the vertex and the parietal region without lateralizing data in one and over the temporal region ipsilateral to the side lesion in the other. The lateralized ictal recording was ipsilateral to the side of structural lesion.  

The ictal rhythm consisted of varied patterns in both groups, with no predominance of any particular type. Theta or delta activities of regular or irregular morphology were observed, as well as rhythmical sharp waves and also paroxysmal fast and electrodecremental patterns.  

In patient 5, the ictal recording preceded the clinical seizure by as much as 26 seconds. The most delayed electrographic recording started 21 seconds after the onset of the clinical seizure in patient 2.  

#### Invasive recording  

In this series, two patients were submitted to invasive evaluation, one in the ACGL-group and the other in the PCGL-group, patients 2 and 5, respectively.  

In patient 2, the ictal recording was diffuse, involving all the recording contacts positioned in the mesial frontal region.  

In patient 5, the ictal recording was focal in only one contact positioned over the lesion and later involved the adjacent contacts that were positioned over the lesion and outside the lesion.  

### Follow-up after surgery  

Seven of the eight patients were submitted to surgery. Five had lesions in the hemisphere dominant for language (Table 40.4). Except for one who was lost to follow-up within a period of less than 1 year, the others had a follow-up of 2–5 years. No patient presented neurological deficits or behavioral alterations after surgery. Among the patients who were submitted to neuropsychological evaluation after surgery (full scale, verbal, and performance IQ), the scores obtained in the postoperative evaluation were basically unchanged compared to those obtained preoperatively (Table 40.4).  

One patient was submitted to a second surgery for more extensive resection due to residual tumor after the first surgery.  

#### Seizure outcome  

Of the seven patients submitted to surgery, one patient had only a 6 month follow-up and was seizure free for 2 months.  

After seizures recurrence a modification in his drug treatment changes were made. In his last follow-up, 6 months after surgery, he was seizure free. Of the other six, one patient in the ACGL-group and one in the PCGL-group remained seizure free (outcome classification 1) up to the last evaluation (Table 40.4). The remainder did not become seizure free, two of them with outcome classification 3 (1–3 seizure-days per year) and two with outcome classification 4 (4 seizure-days per year to $50\%$ reduction of baseline seizure-days) on the of the last follow-up.  

## Discussion  

There are several ways to study the clinical symptomatology of epileptic seizures arising from a given cerebral cortical area. The so-called ‘gold standard’ is to analyze the seizure semiology of patients who became completely seizure free after a relatively restricted cortical resection.45,46 Other methods used are based on information obtained from the onset of the ictalEEG with intracranial electrodes,47 or on the relationship between ictal semiology and the anatomical location of structural lesions, as long as the lesions are not extensive or diffuse.48,49  

In the present series, all patients presented structural damage, with the lesion being of neoplastic nature in all cases but one.  

Although the specific pathophysiological mechanism by which acquired and developmental brain tumors may cause epilepsy is unclear, there are several hypotheses including chronic changes in surrounding cortex, i.e., by direct mechanical or vascular mechanisms,50 hemosiderin deposition,51 and partial isolation of cortical areas.52,53,54 These factors, separately or as a whole, possibly cause alterations in inhibitory and excitatory mechanisms in local circuits. In addition, developmental tumors may be associated with areas of cortical dysplasia55 having intrinsic epileptogenic potential.56 On the basis of these factors, it is quite probable that the clinical manifestations of the epileptic seizures described here were triggered by epileptic discharges originating in the cingulate gyrus and spreading to involve one or more symptomatogenic areas57 close to the structural lesion.  

Semiologic analysis of the epileptic seizures in the ACGLgroup and PCGL-group studied here permitted us to conclude that, whereas the seizures of the anterior cingulate were predominantly motor (complex motor, hypermotor, and bilateral asymmetric tonic seizures), the seizures of the posterior cingulate were characterized by impairment of consciousness (dialeptic seizures) or automatisms of the distal portions of the limbs (automotor seizures), i.e., seizure types frequently present in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy.58,59  

The supplementary motor area is considered to be the symptomatogenic zone for bilateral asymmetric tonic seizures,27,60 whereas the symptomatogenic zone of hypermotor seizures, which frequently occur in patients with frontal lobe epilepsy, is uncertain but may be related to activation of the frontal lobe and/or anterior CG.61,62  

It is not possible to determine if the semiologic ictal manifestations of these series are due to the activation of the CG or are related to the propagation of the ictal discharge. However, the semiology of some seizures, such as bilateral asymmetric tonic seizures, suggest that they were produced by involvement of the supplementary motor. Involvement of the temporal lobe may also explain the ictal semiology of those patients who presented dialeptic seizures or automotor seizures.

Although some of our patients presented lesions very close to what we define as a dividing line between the anterior and posterior cingulated (VPC), we should remember that this division is not arbitrary, but based on cytoarchitectural criteria. Namely, the anterior and posterior CG have cell layers with distinct neuronal populations and distributions and different connections. Even though the CG is extensively connected, each area has preferential efferent connections. In addition to these considerations, it should be pointed out that by selective criteria none of our cases presented large portions of the lesion involving areas outside the CG. These considerations may explain why the semiologic ictal manifestations of epilepsies arising from the anterior cingulated differed from the semiologic manifestations of seizures originating from the posterior cingulate. In other words, while the epileptic seizures of the anterior region most likely spread to involve areas in the adjacent frontal lobe, those of the posterior cortex of the CG tend to involve structures of the temporal lobe.  

The cases reported in the literature support this hypothesis. In the anterior CG group, except for one case whose main clinical manifestation was alteration of consciousness,40 all others suggested involvement of the frontal lobe with hypermotor seizures, tonic seizures, bilateral asymmetric tonic seizures, and gelastic seizures.36–39,41  

It is also worthwhile to stress that the ictal scalp recordings only had limited localizing or lateralizing value in this series. The interictal discharges involved either the region of the vertex or the temporal electrodes in both groups. Only two patients had vertex spikes, four patients had temporal spikes and two patients had no epileptiform discharges. In the ACGL-group two patients had no epileptiform discharges, one had vertex, and one had bitemporal discharges. Of the four patients in the PCGL-group, three had regional interictal discharges in the temporal lobe and one had vertex interictal epileptiform discharges.  

Ictal recordings correctly lateralized the lesion in only three cases No patient presented a contralateral ictal recording. Although the number of patients was small in each group, there seemed to be a tendency to greater difficulties of lateralization and localization in cases with lesion of the anterior cingulate.  

The motor signs during the seizures were lateralizing in four of the eight patients and were characterized by a focal tonic seizure, focal clonic seizure, and versive seizure contralateral to the side of structural lesion. One patient also presented Todd’s paralysis during the postictal period. Thus, the semiologic data of the seizures correctly predicted the side of the structural lesion in five of eight patients. The patient with a versive seizure also presented a focal paradoxical clonic seizure (clonus in the upper limb ipsilateral to the lesion) after the end of a secondarily generalized seizures.  

In this series, in contrast to literature data which consider auras to be rare36 in cingulate epilepsy, five of eight patients reported auras, two of four in the ACGL-group reported pin and needles in the contralateral arm or a heavy contralateral arm, one of four patient in the PCGL-group reported tingling in both legs. This is consistent with the finding that contralateral or bilateral somatosensory symptoms can be produced by electrical cortical stimulation in the superior portion of the mid-CG and in the supplementary sensorimotor area.27,63  

Abdominal auras and psychic auras were also reported by patients in the PCGL-group. Cortical stimulation studies have shown that abdominal aura can be obtained when the superior bank of the sylvian fissure or the adjacent insula region were stimulated.64 Besides, recent studies with stereo-EEG in patients with temporal epilepsy have demonstrated viscerosensitive manifestations characterized by nausea, pain and constriction of the abdominal and thoracic region when the ictal rhythm invades the insula.65 Psychic auras are usually attributed to the temporal neocortex. More recently, structural lesions have been demonstrated in the parietotemporal transition zone of patients with depersonalization feelings.66 All these considerations and the evidence that the posterior CG has extensive connection with the temporal lobe and to the insula, lead us to the conclusion that these auras are most probably due to extension of the epileptic discharges into the temporal lobe and insula.  

All patients had frequent seizures whose duration, however, ranged from a few seconds to a little more than 1 minute in both patient groups. All patients in the ACGL-group had sleep-related seizures, whereas in the PCGL-lesion seizures had no clear relationship to sleep.  

In the ACGL-group two patients were aware during the motor manifestation, while in the CGL-group all patients had loss of consciousness.  

Brief and frequent nocturnal seizures with no impairment of consciousness during the initial motor manifestation (the patient remembers initial motor manifestation) are characteristic features of frontal lobe epilepsies. Therefore, these characteristics seen in seizures of patients with ACGL-group may reflect primarily the pattern of seizure propagation from the anterior cingulate to the frontal lobe.  

Three of the four patients with an anterior lesion had vocalization. Stimulation of the region close to the rostrum of the corpus callosum provokes vocalization in experimental animals. Although the lesion of patient 1 was located exactly in this area, this was the only patient in the ACGL-group that did not produce vocalization.  

The only autonomic manifestation documented was tachycardia. It has been demonstrated that tachycardia is a common phenomenon in focal seizures,67,68 and the anterior cingulate cortex, as well amygdala, and anterior insula are the areas considered the central autonomic network.  

Except for two patients who had invasive monitoring, the remaining ones had stereotactically guided tumor lesionectomy. Lesionectomy or small resections in the anterior or posterior CG did not cause neurological deficits or behavioral disorders; however, it is interesting to note that of the seven patients submitted to surgery, only two became completely seizure free.  

The relation between the tumor mass or the epileptogenic lesion and the epileptogenic zone is extremely important for resections with a favorable outcome regarding seizure control. Although in the presence of tumors the area of ictal onset usually is not associated with a focus remote from the lesion69 and a limited lesionectomy may result in a favorable outcome in selected cases, 70,71 it has been well determined that the area of ictal onset and the epileptogenic zone do not always fully coincide topographically with the structural lesion.69  

There is no clear explanation for the relatively poor outcome for epilepsy surgery in this series. Invasive recordings, even when it localized the seizure onset to one electrode placed in close proximally of the MRI lesion, did not influence the final outcome.  

## Conclusions  

Epileptic seizures secondary to structural lesions localized in the anterior portion of the CG present clinical manifestations relatively different from those of lesions localized in the posterior portion of the CG. Anteriorly localized lesions evolve with predominantly motor manifestations such as bilateral asymmetric tonic seizures, hypermotor seizures and complex motor seizures, while posterior cingulate cortex epilepsies tend to have predominantly alterations of consciousness (dialeptic seizures) and automatisms of the distal portions of the limbs (automotor seizures) as the main clinical manifestations.  

This suggest that epileptic seizures of the anterior cingulate cortex are primarily an expression of seizure spreading into frontal areas, whereas seizures of the posterior cingulate cortex reflect involvement of the temporal lobes.  

On the basis of the clinical characteristics (focal clonic, focal tonic, versive seizures, postictal Todd’s paralysis, and paradoxical clonic seizures), it is possible to predict the side of the lesion in a high percentage of the patients.  

On the other hand scalp interictal and ictal EEG only lateralize or localize the seizures correctly in less than $50\%$ of the cases.  

Lesionectomy in the CG does not cause a neurologic or behavioral deficit, but only a relatively small percentage of patients $(29\%)$ remained seizure free with surgical treatment.  

These results suggest that most probably more extensive resection will be necessary to achieve seizure freedom in a higher percentage of cases.

# 41 Hypothalamic hamartomas AS Harvey  

## Summary  

Hypothalamic hamartoma (HH) are malformations of the hypothalamus that are associated with epilepsy and precocious puberty.   
Gelastic seizures arise from the HH are characterized by ictal laughter and autonomic symptoms, often with minimal change on concurrent scalp-EEG.   
Complex partial seizures with loss of consciousness, automatisms and focal motor features, and focal spikewave on scalp-EEG, occur in some patients as a result of seizure propagation from the HH to frontal and temporal cortex.   
Generalized tonic/atonic seizures and generalized scalpEEG abnormalities develop in many children with HH, seemingly as a result of secondary epileptogenesis affecting the neocortex.   
The neurobiological basis for the range of seizure severity and associated neurobehavioral disturbances seen in patients with HH is not understood.   
An important distinction to be made on MRI is between intraventricular HH attached to the mamillary bodies and infraventricular HH attached to the tuber cinereum, the former more commonly associated with seizures.   
Seizures associated with HH are invariably resistant to medication.   
The best published outcomes in HH surgery are with transcallosal, interforniceal resection or disconnection. Endoscopic procedures are being currently evaluated. Gamma Knife radiosurgery is promising but there is limited outcome data.  

Hypothalamic hamartoma (HH) are tumor-like malformations of the hypothalamus which arise from the tuber cinereum and/or the mamillary bodies on one or both sides. The term HH was first coined by Le Marquand and Russell1 in 1934 to describe such a lesion found at post mortem in a boy with central precocious puberty. HH vary in size, attachment and extension into the third ventricle and suprasellar cistern. Histologically, HH consist of gray matter in which there is some variation in neuronal size, shape, and aggregation.2–9  

HH usually come to clinical attention through their association with central precocious puberty and epilepsy, characteristically epilepsy with gelastic (laughing) seizures. HH and gelastic seizures occur with a prevalence in childhood of approximately 1 in 200 000,10 with a greater proportion of males affected.11 The current literature is biased towards patients with refractory epilepsy and associated neurological problems, largely related to reports of surgical treatments, making it difficult to determine the true spectrum of neurological manifestations. Central precocious puberty occurs in about a third of patients with HH and epilepsy,11,12 usually following the onset of seizures. HH may be asymptomatic, though the prevalence of this is unknown.  

### Seizure manifestations  

The first report of epilepsy associated with a (likely) HH was in 1932,13 in a boy with precocious puberty and mental retardation who died from status epilepticus. The first report of HH associated with gelastic seizures specifically was in 1938.14 Numerous case reports and small patient series were published over the subsequent 50 years. In 1988, Berkovic and colleagues provided the first detailed electroclinical and imaging descriptions of what they proposed was a recognizable and possibly progressive epileptic syndrome of HH and gelastic epilepsy.15  

Gelastic seizures occur in nearly all patients with HH and epilepsy. Onset of gelastic seizures early in life, even from birth, is characteristic.7,10,11,15–19 Gelastic seizures are often described as attacks of inappropriate and mechanical or mirthless laughter. Many patients also have dacrystic (crying) seizures,4,19–26 or seizures in which the facial expression, rhythmic quality of the respirations, and sound produced are discordant mixtures of crying and laughing. Consciousness is usually preserved during brief gelastic seizures.15,19,27 Autonomic features such as flushing, pupillary dilation and breath holding often accompany laughter in gelastic seizures. Recurrent gelastic seizures during wakefulness and sleep are not uncommon in infancy, and when occurring in a relentless fashion have been described as ‘status gelasticus’.28,29 A mild form of gelastic epilepsy is described, usually in adults with small HH, in which seizures manifest with only a ‘pressure to laugh’.30,31 It should be remembered that gelastic seizures may also occur in patients with neocortical epilepsies of frontal and temporal origin,32,33 as well as in patients with brainstem lesions and degenerative diseases.34  

Hypermotor automatisms, oroalimentary automatisms, head and eye deviation, and tonic or clonic facial contraction are often seen in older patients during gelastic seizures. These additional clinical manifestations are invariably seen with impairment of consciousness and described as complex partial seizures, with the implication of frontal and temporal lobe involvement.15,19 Lateralized motor manifestations are typically contralateral to the side of greater hypothalamic attachment in asymmetric HH.  

In more than half of patients with HH and epilepsy, there is a further ‘epileptic progression’ with development of generalized tonic/atonic seizures and tonic-clonic seizures.11 Many patients develop a Lennox-Gastaut syndrome with disabling drop attacks.7,15,35–38 Tonic seizures and spasms associated with HH are often asymmetric, and laughter may precede or follow them. Infantile spasms are reported as a presenting seizure type in patients with HH.10,37,39,40  

### Neurobehavioural manifestations  

Cognitive disturbances in patients with HH and epilepsy are common, especially those in whom seizures begin in childhood. Global developmental delays are particularly common in patients with refractory seizures that begin in infancy and evolve rapidly to partial and generalized seizures with associated generalized EEG disturbances. Cognitive disturbances vary in severity from patients with normal cognition, to patients with impairments of memory, attention, and learning,10,15,31,30,41,42 through to patients with moderate-severe intellectual disability.7,10,35,36,38 Deficits in memory and new learning are most commonly reported but the exact nature of the memory dysfunction is difficult to determine from the reported studies, due to the variable nature of testing and the often associated intellectual impairments. One study suggested cognitive deficits are correlated with seizure frequency and size of HH.42  

Aggressive behavior, rage attacks, anxiety disorder, autism, and other psychiatric comorbidities are widely reported in patients with HH.10,15,35,38,43,44 The relationship between behavior disturbances, seizures and intrinsic hypothalamic dysfunction is uncertain.  

Sleep disturbance is common in patients with HH and epilepsy. In infants and young children, gelastic seizures may occur every few minutes and impair normal sleep-wake cycling.17,19 Similar manifestations are reported in adults,40,45 whereby frequent subclinical gelastic seizures are associated with recurrent sleep arousals. Sleep disturbance may be further exacerbated by continuous epileptic activity on EEG and antiepileptic drugs.  

### Electroencephalographic findings  

Scalp EEG findings in patients with HH vary depending on the age of the patient and the evolution of the seizure disorder. In infants and young children with gelastic seizures only, and in adults with the mild phenotype characterized by only an ‘urge to laugh’, the interictal and ictal EEG are usually normal.46 Such normal EEG findings with gelastic seizures are not widely appreciated and often lead to delayed or incorrect diagnosis.  

Interictal scalp EEG abnormalities may not appear until later childhood,47 often coinciding with the appearance of complex partial and generalized seizures.11 Initially the EEG may only show epileptiform activity when asleep.27 Spikewave activity predominates over the frontal and temporal regions, either in a bilaterally-synchronous or predominantly unilateral fashion.11,48 Unilateral EEG abnormalities tend to occur on the side of predominant HH attachment in asymmetric and unilateral HH. In patients with tonic/atonic seizures, background slowing is common and multifocal or generalized spike-wave activity, paroxysmal fast activity, and electrodecremental patterns are recorded, often with electrical status in sleep.37  

Scalp EEG recordings of seizures in patients with HH and chronic epilepsy usually show suppression of interictal discharges and attenuation of background rhythms, with or without widespread low voltage fast activity.10,15,49 Lateralized and regionalized ictal rhythms or spike-wave activity may follow, potentially giving the misleading impression of frontal or temporal lobe origin of seizures.48 Computerized source analysis of scalp EEG may reveal subcortical sources of early rhythmic activity prior to more superficial cortical sources.49  

Depth EEG recordings from $\mathrm{HH^{4,18,45,50,51}}$ show gelastic seizures are associated with an ictal discharge within the HH that, in most cases, remains confined to the HH. Electrical stimulation of HH using depth electrodes may provoke characteristic ictal laughter. In contrast, depth EEG recordings of tonic seizures reveal ictal onset in cortical regions remote from the HH,4 with medial frontal and lateral temporal areas being prominent.50  

### Neuroimaging findings  

HH vary in size from $5{-}40\mathrm{mm}$ and vary in their attachment and extension (Figure 41.1). MRI is far superior to CT brain in revealing and characterizing HH.15 Small HH may be difficult to detect unless the hypothalamic region is specifically examined. T2-weighted sequences in the three orthogonal planes are well suited to displaying the HH in relation to the heavily-myelinated hypothalamic nuclei and tracts. HH usually have increased signal on T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences and low signal on T1-weighted sequences, compared to grey and white matter. They do not enhance with contrast and on serial imaging remain in proportion with the rest of the brain.12 HH associated with Pallister-Hall syndrome are often larger than sporadic HH and are isointense with gray matter on T2-weighted images.52 Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) demonstrates relatively decreased Nacetylaspartate and increased myoinositol levels compared to normal gray matter,12,53 suggesting neuronal attenuation and relative gliosis. Increased signal on T2-weighted images is correlated with gliosis on MRS and histological examination.53  

Several anatomically-based classifications of HH based on MRI features have been proposed, distinguishing different sizes and patterns of hamartoma attachment to the hypothalamus.2,36,54–58 The most important categorization from clinical, pathophysiological and surgical perspectives is the distinction between HH within the third ventricle that are attached to the mamillary bodies and/or the medial hypothalamus (sessile, intraventricular, intrahypothalamic), from HH beneath the third ventricle with attachment to the tuber cinereum (pedunculated, extraventricular, parahypothalamic).  

In a systematic review of MRI in 72 patients with epilepsy and HH, Freeman and colleagues reported mamillary body attachment in all, with intrahypothalamic extension between the fornices and mamillothalamic tracts seen in the majority.12 In contrast, HH associated with isolated precocious puberty tend to be pedunculated and not involve the third ventricle.59 The association of HH size with endocrine versus neurological manifestations is variably reported, with no consistent relationship identified.12,30,52,59 A possible interpretation of the data is that large HH are associated with the combination of endocrine and neurological manifestations, due to attachment and distortion of multiple hypothalamic regions; conversely, small pedunculated HH are more commonly associated with isolate precocious puberty59 and small intrahypothalamic HH are more commonly associated with isolated12 and sometimes milder epilepsy.

Figure 41.1 Coronal MRI scans of HH in three patients with gelastic epilepsy. (a) and (c) show intraventricular HH attached to the medial hypothalamus bilaterally; (B) shows a pedunculated HH attached predominantly to the tuber cinereum on the right, although still with a small intraventricular connection. The HH in (a) and (b) are relatively isointense with gray matter on the T1-weighted images, while the HH in (c) is hyperintense on the FLAIR image compared to the rest of the cerebrum.  

Occasionally, HH are seen in association with dysgenesis of the corpus callosum, gray matter heterotopias, arachnoid cysts, and microgyria.2,12,60 Anterior temporal lobe white matter changes are seen in a minority of patients with HH, but despite the severity and frequency of seizures in many patients, hippocampal sclerosis is not reported.  

Positron emission tomography (PET) studies are few but report areas of cortical hypometabolism, lateralization usually being concordant with the side of HH attachment.7,61 PET during a period of ‘status gelasticus’ revealed hypermetabolism in the HH.29 Ictal single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) during gelastic seizures have consistently reported focal hyperperfusion in the region of the HH (Figure 41.2).17,18,62,63 Asymmetric cerebral perfusion during seizures is common in patients with HH,10 with hyperperfusion ipsilateral to the side of predominant HH attachment, suggesting preferential cortical spread of seizure activity from the HH.64 Group analyses of seizure propagation with ictal SPECT suggest preferential cortical spread to medial frontal and lateral temporal regions,64 consistent with depth EEG studies.50  

## Epileptogenesis associated with hypothalamic hamartoma  

HH usually occur sporadically and in isolation. Rarely, HH may occur as part of the autosomal dominant Pallister-Hall syndrome which includes HH, hypopituitarism, polydactyly, midline defects, and imperforate anus.65 Patients with Pallister-Hall syndrome have mutations of the transcription factor gene $G l i3,^{66,67}$ but the role of Gli3 in patients with sporadic HH is unknown68 and thus the etiology of sporadic, nonsyndromic HH remains uncertain.  

Distortion of the hypothalamus or brainstem by HH was originally believed to be the basis of seizures in this syndrome,22 as irritation of the third ventricular floor and mamillary bodies was known to induce laughter.69,70 With later appreciation of the severe and often generalized nature of seizures and neurological disturbances in many patients with HH, it was later proposed that patients with HH had widespread occult cerebral dysgenesis.15,71 This view that HH were perhaps just an epiphenomenon of more significant epileptic disturbance in the neocortex led to unsuccessful temporal and frontal resections in many patients with localized EEG patterns.8,20,72,73  

From the mid-1990s, evidence accumulated proving that gelastic seizures arose from HH, evidence coming from stereotactic depth EEG recording of seizures from HH,4,18,50,51,74 reproduction of ictal symptoms with electrical stimulation of HH,4,18,50 and demonstration of HH hyperperfusion with ictal $\mathrm{SPECT^{18,62}}$ and PET.29 HH have been shown to be intrinsically epileptogenic,75 with pacemaker-like spontaneous repetitive firing demonstrated in small HH neurons within cell clusters.76  

The reasons for the variability in onset and severity of epileptic manifestations of epileptogenic HH is however unknown. As discussed above, the attachment of HH is more important than their size in determining endocrine versus neurological manifestations, with mamillary body involvement and third ventricular distortion being strongly correlated with epileptogenicity,12,54,55,59 however variability of neurological manifestations between patients with epileptogenic HH is not understood.  

Clinical evidence suggests that complex partial seizures in patients with HH result from seizure propagation to medial frontal and lateral temporal cortical regions,49,50,64 and that generalized tonic seizures represent independent neocortical phenomena.4,50 Similarly, interictal scalp EEG abnormalities arise from secondary cortical regions, either independently or triggered by discharges arising in the HH.4,37,50 In patients with symptomatic generalized epilepsy (SGE), generalized and multifocal interictal epileptiform discharges persist over the neocortex and scalp immediately following resection of the $\mathrm{HH},{^{37}}$ frequently reducing in the weeks and months that follow, providing further evidence of the independent nature of scalp EEG abnormalities. The apparent epileptic progression in many patients with HH, and in particular the electroclinical and behavioral features of SGE, may in fact represent a process of secondary epileptogenesis affecting the cerebral cortex, $^{4,37,50}$ perhaps mediated through mamillo-halamo-cingulate pathways.50

English literature by 2006. Today, epilepsy due to HH is considered a surgically-remediable condition.75,78–80 Many microsurgical, endoscopic, and radiosurgical techniques for resection, disconnection, and ablation of HH are reported and a brief review is provided below. The diagnostic evaluation for patients with HH undergoing epilepsy surgery is similar to that for patients with refractory epilepsy of cortical origin except for the need for perioperative endocrine assessment, the need for high-resolution imaging of midline brain structures, and a reduced emphasis on scalp EEG localization of seizures and interictal discharges.81  

## Surgical treatment  

Antiepileptic medications are generally ineffective in the treatment of seizures associated with HH.10,15 While they may have some impact on the severity or frequency of partial and generalized seizures, antiepileptic drugs usually have little impact on gelastic seizures. Some patients gain partial benefit from vagal nerve stimulation.10,77 The management of precocious puberty associated with HH is no longer surgical, with patients now treated with gonadotrophin releasing hormone agonists.  

In the last two decades, there have been numerous reports of successful surgical treatment of epilepsy associated with HH, with more than 200 operated patients reported in the  

### Pterional and frontotemporal resection and disconnection  

Pterional and frontotemporal craniotomies provide access to the inferior part of the HH via subtemporal, subfrontal, transsylvian or transcortical approaches, sometimes performed with temporal pole or orbital cortical resection.7,36,47,55,82,83 These approaches to epileptogenic HH are often ineffective in controlling seizures, as only the infraventricular portion of the HH can be resected, leaving the important intraventricular component attached to the mamillary bodies and medial hypothalamus.7,75,78 Furthermore, endocrinopathies, stroke and third nerve palsies are not infrequent complications with these approaches.7,36  

### Transcallosal, anterior interforniceal resection, and disconnection  

An interhemispheric, transcallosal approach to resection of HH was first reported by Rosenfeld and colleagues.84 This approach passes between the columns of the fornices and leaves of the septum pellucidum to enter the third ventricle, allowing direct vision of the intraventricular component of the HH. With microsurgical technique, the neurosurgeon can obtain complete or near-complete resection or disconnection of the HH at its attachment to the mamillary bodies and medial hypothalamus, down to the floor of the third ventricle (Figure 41.3). In the 56 reported patients who have undergone transcallosal resection or disconnection of HH at two centers,35,38 seizure freedom or ${>}90\%$ seizure reduction is reported in $80\%$ with associated improvement in behavior and learning in the majority of these. Most striking in these series was the improvement in patients with SGE, in whom there was often marked improvement or remission of tonic seizures, generalized spike-wave discharges on EEG, and language and behavioral problems.35,37,38 Morbidity in these series consisted of short term memory impairment, weight gain, hypothyroidism, and transient hypernatremia,35,38,85 with neurovascular complications being rare.  

### Stereotactic radiosurgery  

Several radiosurgical approaches to treatment of epilepsy associated with HH are reported. All deliver ionizing radiation to a stereotactically defined intracranial target, with a steep radiation fall-off outside of the treated volume, the aim being to cause tissue damage or physiological change in the HH. Gamma Knife is reported in 46 patients,56,57,86–90 but seizure outcome is reported in only 16 (6 seizure free or $>90\%$ seizure reduction). Stereotactic radiosurgery with the linear accelerator4,91 and implantation of 125I seeds92,93 are reported by a few centers, with seizure-free or near seizure-free outcomes reported in about half. Minimal morbidity and short hospital stay are clear advantages of stereotactic radiosurgery, whereas delayed seizure reduction is a potential disadvantage and certainly limits outcomes presently reported in the literature. Radiosurgery may be best suited to the treatment of smaller HH, or perhaps the intrahypothalamic component of large HH.  

### Minimally-invasive stereotactic techniques  

Radiofrequency thermocoagulation, via stereotactic or open approaches, produces small necrotic lesions in the HH by radiofrequency heating of the tip of an electrode, often following recording and stimulation of seizures. Relatively low seizure-free rates are reported (only half being seizure free or having ${>}90\%$ seizure reduction) and repeat procedures are not uncommon.18,23,40,94,95 Like stereotactic radiosurgery, radiofrequency thermocoagulation may be best suited for small HH.

Neuroendoscopy is being increasingly reported as a means of resection or disconnection of HH (Figure 41.4),7,36,95–97 with seizure freedom or ${>}90\%$ seizure reduction reported in about $60\%$ patients. Third ventricular access is generally transcortical, through the lateral ventricle and foramen of Monro. Delalande employs both frontotemporal and transcortical endoscopic approaches to disconnection of infraventricular and intraventricular components of HH.36 Endoscopic surgery is presently limited by tools for safe and complete resection of HH tissue, though recent technical advances are reported.97,98 Postoperative hospital stay is reduced but there is limited data on efficacy and safety to compare third ventricular endoscopic surgery with transcallosal surgery and stereotactic radiosurgery.  

Overall, short-term Engel class I or II outcomes are reported in about two thirds of patients undergoing transcallosal or endoscopic resection and/or disconnection of HH from within the third ventricle, these approaches being superior in efficacy to reported outcomes from pterional and frontotemporal resections and radiofrequency ablative techniques. When greater than two year seizure outcomes are reported from a prospective study of Gamma Knife surgery in HH,56 it may become apparent that stereotactic radiosurgery is an equal or superior technique, at least in older patients with small HH and time to wait for seizure improvement. Callosotomy, neocortical resection and pterional/frontotemporal HH resections are inferior surgical approaches that are no longer advocated.36,48,99  

## Conclusions  

Previously an uncommon, poorly-understood, neurologicallydevastating and untreatable epileptic syndrome, HH and gelastic epilepsy is now better understood and surgically-remediable. Optimum management of patients requires awareness of pathological laughter as a potential seizure symptom, acceptance of normal scalp EEG findings early in the course of the epilepsy, careful imaging and inspection of the hypothalamic region with MRI, recognition of the potential detrimental effects of seizures on neurological development, and early referral to a neurosurgical center with experience in treatment of HH. Further studies of surgical outcomes, with large patient numbers and adequate follow-up, are awaited to compare the merits of different approaches and timing of surgical interventions.

# 42 Rasmussen syndrome  

In 1958, the Montreal neurosurgeon Theodore B. Rasmussen published a report on three pediatric patients under the title ‘Focal seizures due to chronic localized encephalitis’.1 This is an unusual condition typically developing in childhood, and is characterized by the occurrence of refractory partial epilepsy, often with epilepsia partialis continua (EPC), associated with progressive hemiparesis and cognitive impairment. Neuroimaging reveals progressive unilateral hemispheric atrophy. The Montreal Neurological Institute continuously treated patients with this disorder. However, it took another about thirty years until reports started to appear from other parts of the world. From this time on, most researchers and clinicians have adopted the term Rasmussen syndrome (RS) or (Rasmussen encephalitis) for this condition.2,3  

## Clinical presentation and seizure semiology  

### Typical features  

The ‘typical RS patient’ can be described as follows: he or she (there is no gender predominance in RS) starts experiencing intractable unilateral focal motor seizures or temporal lobe seizures at the age of six years. Later on, when the disease process spreads across the affected hemisphere, new seizure semiologies indicating new epileptogenic areas are often observed. EPC is not infrequently seen. This type of focal motor status epilepticus is characterised by repetitive, brief, regular or irregular, quite monomorphic myoclonic jerks. Distal rather than proximal muscle groups are affected. Physical exercise, sensitive stimulation or psychic exertion may increase the amplitude and frequency of the myoclonic jerks. The upper half of the body is more frequently affected than the lower one. EPC more often continues during sleep – sometimes in a milder form – than does it stop.4 This seizure type is not a unique feature of RS.5–7 However, in childhood, RS is its most frequent cause. Within a few months of the manifestation of epilepsy, progressive loss of neurological function associated with one hemisphere starts. Typical features are hemiparesis, hemianopia and (if the dominant side is affected) aphasia.8,9 After on average eight months, the main decline is over, and the patient passes into a residual stage with a rather stable neurological deficit and cerebral hemiatrophy.9 Seizure frequency is still high but not as much as during the previous ‘acute stage’.9 In reality, this ‘average’ or ‘typical’ RS patient is rarely seen. Due to the complexity of potential symptoms, the presentation of RS can take a variety of different forms.  

### Less common presentation forms of RS  

Since the original description of RS, a variety of other presentations have been recognized. Although RS typically develops in children, the condition has also been described in adult life.10–12 In the majority of these cases the course appears to be slower and less severe. Villani et al. distinguished two phenotypes in adults: an ‘epileptic’ form, characterised by focal motor epilepsy refractory to antiepileptic drug treatment, and a ‘myoclonic’ form, in which EPC and/or unilateral cortical myoclonus (focal or multifocal) are the prominent features. Although secondary spread of seizures to the contralateral side, or a minor degree of contralateral atrophy is sometimes seen in patients with RS, true bilateral involvement in the form of bilateral inflammation has only rarely been described.13–15 The bilateral nature of these unusual cases became apparent within 13 months of disease onset. Of note, no case of subsequent spread to the opposite side has been reported following the successful hemispheric surgical treatment of unilateral RS.  

Dual pathology, i.e. a second cerebral abnormality such as cortical dysplasia, vascular abnormality or tuberous sclerosis in association with RS has been found in approximately $10\%$ of patients,16 leading to speculation that a breach in the blood–brain barrier may play a part in the genesis of the disease.  

Patients with an otherwise typical RS course have been observerd who experienced delayed seizure onset,17 or even the absence of seizures.18  

In a few patients, movement disorders including hemiathetosis and hemidystonia have been described in addition to EPC.19,20  

## Diagnostic tests  

### Brain imaging  

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  

Brain MRI has become a mainstay of diagnostic evaluation and follow-up in RS.21,22 Serial investigations reveal focal cortical and subcortical T2/FLAIR signal increases followed by progressive, centrifugal hemiatrophy of the cerebral hemisphere contralateral to the affected side of the body. The onset of MRI visible first changes is usually noted around the Sylvian fissure. The head of the ipsilateral caudate nucleus is usually included in this hemiatrophic process, and is particularly easily ascertained.21,22  

### Other neuroimaging techniques  

Positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) are techniques not suitable for defining the inflammatory nature of the condition (for a literature survey, see ref. 23). However, these techniques may be helpful in confirming the unihemispheric nature in patients with suspected recent onset disease.  

### Electroencephalography  

The most characteristic EEG abnormalities in RS are polymorphic delta waves over the affected hemisphere. These waves are for the most part found in temporal and central leads. Epileptiform abnormalities with frequent evolvement into electrographic seizures are regularly observed. During the disease course, background activity shows progressive flattening. In the majority of patients, contralateral asynchronous slow waves and epileptiform discharges occur.24 Later on, these contralateral abnormalities may be even more frequent than the ipsilateral ones.25,26 It must be emphasized that these contralateral abnormalities are not sufficient to make the diagnosis of bilateral disease. They are likely to arise from rapid spread from the primarily affected hemisphere, and they should not be taken as a cause to reject an otherwise suitable patient from hemispherectomy. As with other conditions with cortical epileptic myoclonus, EPC in RS is not always accompanied by ictal contralateral EEG discharges on surface EEG.25  

### Laboratory tests  

#### CSF studies  

Only about $50\%$ of RS patients have abnormal cerebrospinal cell counts $(16{-}70~\mathrm{cells}/\upmu\mathrm{l},$ predominantly lymphocytes) and protein content $(50{-}100~\mathrm{mg/dl})$ .8,27 Oligoclonal bands have been an inconsistent finding, ranging from $0{-}67\%$ .24,28,29 Standard CSF studies (in combination with serological tests) are helpful to rule out a CNS infection by a known neurotropic agent during the process of excluding differential diagnoses. Stand-alone standard CSF tests, however, are not sufficient to exclude or confirm the diagnosis of RS.  

#### Blood tests  

The serum test for antibodies to the glutamate receptor subunit 3 antibodies (GluR3 abs), published in the mid-1990s,30 is no longer considered sensitive of specific for the diagnosis of RS. This has become evident from several recent studies.31–33 To conclude, this test can no longer be regarded as a useful diagnostic method. At present, no other diagnostically helpful blood test is available for patients with suspected RS.  

### Brain biopsy  

Recently, an international consensus has been made on the role of brain biopsy in the diagnosis of RS.23 It is indicated only in patients in which the diagnosis of RS is suspected but can neither be sufficiently supported by cross-sectional, noninvasive assessment (part A criteria of the European consensus criteria, see Table 42.1) nor by demonstration of the progressive nature of the condition (part B criteria, #1 and 2). This is usually the case in patients with very recent onset of clinical symptoms suggestive of RS – e.g., in a patient with otherwise unexplained recent onset EPC. Such a patient may profit from rapid definite diagnosis by brain biopsy because subsequent timely initiation of long-term immunotherapy (see below)

may prevent irreversible loss of brain tissue and related neurological functions. An open brain biopsy collecting a piece of brain with an intact relation of meninges, gray and white matter is preferable. Stereotactic biopsies have a relatively high probability of leading to false negative results (frequent sampling error due to small specimen size). In RS brains, pathological and seemingly normal brain areas may lay closely together. Even in the case of an open brain biopsy, extensive neuropathological evaluation of serial sections may be necessary to detect the characteristic inflammatory changes. The biopsy should ideally be obtained from a non-eloquent brain area with increased T2/FLAIR MRI signal.21 A systematic study of a large sample of hemidecortication specimens revealed that frontal or temporal lobe areas are more likely to contain diagnostically valuable inflammatory infiltrates than more posteriorly collected specimens.34 There are less histopathological differential diagnoses than sometimes assumed. Main alternative diagnoses are chronic viral encephalitides35 and – in adults – paraneoplastic encephalitis36,37 and nonparaneoplastic limbic encephalitis.38 These disorders can be distinguished by the clinical presentation, neuroimaging and additional laboratory studies. If the results of brain biopsy are not clearly abnormal and therefore considered inconclusive, this may be due to the above mentioned sampling error. In this case, further clinical and MRI follow-up studies (e.g. every 6 months) are needed to establish or exclude the progressive nature of the condition.  

### Neuropsychology  

Neuropsychology testing does not provide positive diagnostic evidence in favour or against a diagnosis of RS. Repeated testing, however, may provide highly valuable information on the progression of cognitive decline. Language studies are of particular importance because aphasic disturbances may suggest involvement of the language dominant hemisphere. If hemispherectomy is considered, language laterality must be determined. Language functional MRI testing may in selected cases be an adequate tool for this purpose. However, its applicability can be impaired in RS patients by their frequently reduced ability to follow the instructions and by the limited morphological comparability of the two hemispheres due to unilateral atrophy and subsequent hemispherical asymmetry.39 Determination of language lateralisation therefore mostly requires the performance of a Wada test.  

### Diagnostic criteria of RS  

The most characteristic and unique features of RS are the progressive unilateral loss of function and the progressive hemispheric atrophy occurring over several months or a few years. This acute stage is followed by a quite stable residual stage. Prior to the acute stage, a non-specific prodromal period with less frequent seizures and sometimes a mild neurological deficit can be observed.9  

To standardize the diagnosis of RS, a European consensus panel recently proposed formal diagnostic criteria,23 which are given in Table 42.1  

### Differential diagnoses  

Lists of potential differential diagnoses are long. In reality, however, most can be relatively quickly checked and ruled out or confirmed. The major alternative diagnoses are those of non-inflammatory unilateral epileptic syndromes such as malformations due to abnormal cortical development, SturgeWeber syndrome, stroke, hemiconvulsion-hemiplegiaepilepsy syndrome, and tumours including gliomatosis cerebri. Rarely, other causes of EPC have to be excluded, particularly: metabolic disorders (mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes; renal or hepatic encephalopathy) or inflammatory conditions (vasculitis, HIV, Russian spring-summer meningoencephalitis and a few others). For an extensive list, see the recent consensus statement.23  

## Pathophysiology  

The neuropathological hallmarks of RS are inflammation, neuronal loss, the presence of microglia activation, microglial nodules and astrogliosis. These characteristics have been described as early as in the index publication;1 they have been elaborated in more detail by the Montreal group.40 Pathological investigations in RS have been focused on the nature of the inflammatory response. Many earlier studies have dealt with (herpes-)viruses as potentially causative factors.41–46 Still, although these reports suggested the presence of viruses, and treatment with ganciclovir decreased seizures temporarily in some patients,47 a causal association of RS with a specific virus was never found. As mentioned above, neuronal damage by an antibody-mediated immune response through antibodies directed to the glutamate receptor subunit 3 (GluR3) was postulated.30 Subsequent studies suggested that such antibodies not only killed neurons via an antibody or complement mediated attack,48 but also that such antibodies might kill neurons via direct activation of the receptor ion channel.49 Later, it became clear that anti-GluR3 antibodies were not present in all RS patients and were also found in other forms of epilepsy.31–33 However, there is continuous evidence that plasmapheresis or immunoadsorption are effective in some patients. It seems likely that in these patients indeed autoimmune antibodies contribute to pathogenesis. The antigenic specificity of the underlying antibodies remains unclear. Recently, antibodies against the neuronal alpha7 acetylcholine receptor have been found in two RS patients.50  

Recent reports have analysed the composition of the immune cells in the brains of patients with RS and found evidence that cytotoxic T cells play a role in RS. The T lymphocyte fraction in the brain parenchyma is mainly composed of $\mathrm{CD8^{+}}$ cells. $\mathrm{CD4^{+}}$ cells are present, but accumulate in the perivascular space of blood vessels rather than migrate into the parenchyma.51 Other immune cells coming from the bloodstream, like macrophages, B cells, plasma cells and natural killer cells are present in low numbers.36,51 The infiltration of T lymphocytes and density of microglia nodules (focal accumulations of activated microglial cells) are inversely correlated with disease duration as well as with neuronal loss.21 Whereas during the course of disease neuronal loss increases, the presence of $\mathrm{\DeltaT}$ lymphocytes gradually subsides to a level which, however, is still well above that found in normal individuals.21 About one tenth of the T cells in the inflammatory lesions are GranzymeB+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes.51 Some of these cells were found in close apposition to neurons with polarisation of the cytotoxic granules towards the neuronal membrane. This suggests that a cytotoxic T cell response against neurons might be responsible for neuronal loss. Further evidence suggests a specific T cell mediated destruction of neurons in RS: restricted T cell populations have expanded from a few precursor T cells specifically directed against distinct antigenic epitopes.52  

Another prominent feature of RS is astrocyte activation. Moreover, a recent study showed that in RS there are also areas that reveal a dramatic loss of these astrocytes.53 These astrocytes apparently also die by apoptosis induced by Granzyme- $\cdot\mathrm{B^{+}}$ cytotoxic T cells. Astrocytes support neurons by many different functions, such as maintenance of potassium homeostasis and regulation of GABA and glutamate, neurotransmitters critically involved in epileptic processes. Therefore astrocytes are indispensable for normal functioning of neurons. Both the presence of hypertrophic astrocytes as well as their loss may have a serious impact on the disease severity.  

## Treatment  

Treatment in RS has two aims: first, to reduce (or ideally: eliminate) the epileptic seizures, and secondly, to counteract the progressive tissue loss during the acute disease stage in order to improve the functional long-term outcome of patients.  

### Anti-seizure treatment  

Antiepileptic drugs are started as soon as seizures start, but the seizures are often refractory to treatment. These drugs have no effect on the underlying course of the disease. Treatment should be adjusted to cause only a minimum of side-effects.54 Injections of botulinum toxin have been successfully applied against localised EPC and other involuntary movements.55,56  

The most efficient treatment against seizures has been hemispherectomy with seizure freedom rates of up to $85\%$ (for a summary of outcome studies, see ref. 23). The anatomical hemispherectomies originally performed have now been largely superseded by functional hemispherectomy, involving disconnection techniques. Most neurosurgeons agree that in experienced centres, the individual technique of deafferentation should not influence seizure outcome, but only the rate of complications (lower with less invasive procedures). The exclusion of one hemisphere leaves the patient with a spastic hemiparesis without fine finger movements but usually with preserved walking ability (if there has not been a major surgical complication, if the patient was ambulatory prior to the operation and if he is not left with extremely frequent seizures afterwards).57 In addition, a hemispherical procedure inevitably leads to a homonymous hemianopia. Patients seem to adapt rather well to this kind of disability.58 Exclusions of the dominant hemisphere lead to high-grade aphasias. Whereas in such patients some receptive abilities may be regained postoperatively, no more than a telegraphic speech output is achieved by them.59  

The cognitive performance beyond the language aspect is not relevantly impaired by exclusion of the diseased hemisphere.60 Sometimes (apparently because of the postoperatively lowered or even totally eliminated drug load and seizure activity), patients achieve a strong relief and a clear improvement in their day-to-day abilities.61 The mortality of hemispherectomy in its modern variants (in RS and other conditions) has been $0{-}4\%$ , the complication rate (including hydrocephalus requiring shunt placement) $0{-}44\%$ 57,58,60,62–65. Such a wide range in complications is striking. One important variable that accounts for this is the surgical methodology utilized, whether based on resection or disconnection. Disconnective techniques (functional hemispherectomy and hemispherotomy) are associated with a lower incidence of complications.65–68 It must be noted that more focal resections have never been reported to be successful. They lead to an improvement in seizure control only in the short term, if at all.62,69  

### Treatment directed against hemispheric cerebral degeneration  

Existing data indicate that in RS brain cells degenerate because of chronic inflammatory processes. Immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory treatments are therefore promising candidates to prevent tissue loss and improve the functional longterm outcome of affected individuals. Several treatment approaches have been reported in case reports or small, usually uncontrolled patient series, mostly with beneficial effects. As judged from these publications, most positive experience exists with long-term corticosteroids,13,70,71 intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG),70–72 plasmapheresis or protein A immunoabsorption, 71,73,74 and oral tacrolimus.75  

### Suggestions for individual treatment regimens  

The majority of RS patients suffer from epileptic seizures. Therefore, anticonvulsive pharmacotherapy is usually indicated. Epilepsy due to RS is often refractory to treatment and EPC is notoriously difficult to control: it is important to avoid excess treatment, and particularly polytherapy with multiple antiepileptic drugs, with their associated adverse effects, most prominently sedation.54 Injections of botulinum toxin may be helpful in the management of involuntary movements and localised myoclonus associated with RS.55,56 If, as is common, intractable seizures persist, the option of hemispherectomy should be considered and the potential benefit should be weighed against the deficits that are to |be expected. Most centers would not perform this operation in patients with still functional fine finger movements or patients with language representation within the affected hemisphere. If, however, the condition or its treatment causes such severe impairments that the expected benefits of surgery appear to outweigh the likely deficits, hemispherectomy may be offered.  

In those patients in whom hemispherectomy is considered inappropriate, long-term immunotherapy with one of the above named treatments is indicated if the condition is still progressive (as judged by the clinical and neuroradiological course over the previous 6–12 months). The principal aim of this type of intervention is prevention of structural and functional decline of the affected hemisphere. There is insufficient evidence to recommend any specific regimen. The most frequently reported successful regimens are: (1) long-term corticosteroids13,70,71,76; (2) intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG)70–72,77–79; (3) corticosteroids plus $\mathrm{IVIG}^{70,80,81}$ ; (4) plasmapheresis or protein A IgG immunoadsorption71,73,74,82; and (5) tacrolimus.75

In general, the tolerability and the effect of long-term immunotherapy should be evaluated every 6–12 months. If the disease progresses during this time in the form of additional neurological deficits or increasing cerebral hemiatrophy, the treatment should be changed. When treatment is able to prevent further disease progression, it is unclear when immunotherapy may be discontinued. One might estimate that it would be reasonable to continue treatment until the patient’s condition has been stable for at least 3 years (rather, for a longer period of time).

The Landau-Kleffner Syndrome (LKS) is an acquired epileptic aphasia or verbal auditory agnosia of childhood that results from an epileptogenic lesion in speech cortex (or that impacts speech cortex) during a critical period of language development. LKS is a disorder that occurs in children who have already developed age-appropriate language function and it is one of the epileptic encephalopathies with the electrographic pattern of Continuous Spikes and Waves during Slow Sleep (CSWS). The LKS was described in 1957 by William Landau and Frank Kleffner1 in a report of six children, five of whom developed an acquired aphasia in association with an epileptic seizure disorder consisting of ‘petit mal’ ‘grand mal’ and myoclonic seizures. The aphasia had developed over days to months and persisted from 2 weeks to several years. These authors attributed the language dysfunction to the impact of the epileptic activity in language cortex. Indeed, they identified bilateral epileptiform activity in the children’s EEG recordings pointing out the predominant involvement of the temporal lobes and suggested a relation between the severity of the paroxysmal discharges on EEG and the severity of language disturbance. In 1989, LKS was included in the International Classification of Epileptic Syndromes,2 giving it legitimacy as a recognized clinical entity.  

language disturbances in children with ‘true’ LKS, while this does not appear the case in children with LKS-look-alike or those with CSWS syndrome or ASD (see below).  

### Etiology of LKS  

The LKS does not have a single etiology. For example, an analysis of neuropathologic specimens of 22 consecutive children that underwent epilepsy surgery at the Rush Epilepsy Center revealed a variety of abnormalities: astrocytosis was identified in 11 $(52\%)$ , ectopic neurons in two $(9.5\%)$ , focal displasia in another two $(9.5\%)$ , while no abnormal findings were identified in six patients $(29\%)$ ; no specimen was available for analysis in one child. Likewise, Cole and collaborators5 have identified a variety of pathologic entities in their series of children with LKS including neurocysticercosis, encephalitis, vasculitis, subpial gliosis and neuronal migration disorder. It should be noted that the absence of pathologic findings in several of these children may be a function of having taken an insufficient amount of tissue for neuropathologic analysis as there is hesitation to remove tissue from presumed language areas, even if they show the most active epileptic discharges and the mapping of eloquent cortex is not an option when language is so severely impaired.  

### Epidemiologic aspects  

The actual incidence and prevalence of LKS remains unknown at this time. Its prevalence is rare if the strict clinical diagnostic criteria proposed by Landau and Kleffner are applied. Recognition of LKS has increased over time as 81 cases were reported between the years of 1957 and 1980 and 117 cases between 1980 and 1990. Yet, the reported cases are more likely to include children with the more severe forms of the disease, while those in whom language disturbances remit spontaneously after a short period of time are less likely to be recognized and reported.  

Ascertainment of the actual prevalence and incidence of LKS has been further complicated by the ‘dilution’ of its diagnostic criteria in the last decade. Indeed, the term ‘LKS-look-alike’ disorder has been applied to children with language disturbances who in the past would have been considered to suffer from an Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or children with the CSWS syndrome.3 This diagnostic confusion has significant implications when the surgical option is being considered, as epilepsy surgery is thought to be more likely to improve  

### Clinical manifestations of LKS  

The diagnosis of LKS is based on a set of clinical, electrographic and neuropsychological characteristics.  

#### Clinical criteria  

The clinical manifestations of LKS include language disturbances, behavioral problems with or without sleep disturbances, epileptic seizures (and/or very abnormal EEG recordings with epileptiform activity), and abnormal findings in verbally mediated cognitive functions with sparing of visually mediated functions.6–9 The symptoms of LKS appear between the ages of 2 and 8 years in children who had a normal language development with an acute or subacute onset, though occasionally they may take a stuttering initial course.  

Language disturbances present initially as problems with verbal comprehension that progress in severity to a total inability to understand what is being said to them as well as to recognize common sounds (auditory agnosia). It is not infrequent for these children to be initially misdiagnosed with acquired deafness.6,7 Concurrent with, or a short time after the onset of receptive language disturbances the child starts displaying signs of expressive language deficits such as paraphasias and phonological errors. The establishment of normal language development is of the essence in distinguishing children with LKS from children with other types of language disturbances including children with an autistic spectrum disorder (ASD). In fact, it is not infrequent that parents may give an ‘erroneous impression’ of normal cognitive developmental milestones in their child. Yet, a careful analysis by speech pathologists of home video-tapes during the ‘asymptomatic’ development of these children can often reveal delayed expressive and/or receptive language functions relative to the chronologic age.  

The onset of language disturbances (and of other clinical symptoms) has been linked in-time with the onset of clinical seizures or a short time after. Electrographic evidence of epileptiform activity presenting as a pattern of CSWS or long runs of bisynchronous or unilateral epileptiform discharges in temporo-parietal and frontal derivations can be identified in patients without obvious clinical seizures at the time of onset of language disturbances. These electrographic data coupled with the language disturbances help clinicians to consider the possibility of LKS.  

Language disturbances can progress in a steady or fluctuating manner to a state of complete mutism in the course of a few days to a few weeks, or as stated above, in a few children, they may follow a stuttering course.8,9 The duration of language disturbances may vary among patients. At one end of the spectrum are children that are symptomatic for periods of only days to weeks followed by complete spontaneous remission.6 At the other end, are children whose language disturbance progresses to a global aphasia and auditory agnosia, occasionally with a waxing and waning course but with no meaningful recovery of any functional language despite multiple pharmacologic interventions.9–17 In some children a careful history can often reveal fluctuations in the severity of language disturbances with intermittent periods of improvement in expressive and/or receptive language functions of variable magnitude. These fluctuations in symptom severity can often, but not always be associated with a parallel improvement or worsening of seizure frequency.  

Children with LKS are often able to communicate through nonverbal means such as sign language. For example among 22 consecutive children with classic LKS evaluated at the Rush Epilepsy Center for epilepsy surgery, 11 $(50\%)$ had learned to use sign language.4  

There have been unfortunately few studies that have investigated the long-term course of language disturbances in LKS patients. Mantovani and Landau10 found a significant recovery in language functions in four of nine patients who were reevaluated 10–28 years after the onset of their symptoms. On the other hand, only one of seven patients followed by Deonna et al.11 into adulthood recovered language functions completely; a second patient recovered functional language but was left with severe dyslexia, a third patient exhibited significant deficits in comprehensive language while the other four patients continued to suffer from global aphasia. Various investigators have concluded that spontaneous recovery of functional language in the long-term is unlikely in patients with persistent language disturbances for more than one year.9,10,12–17  

While the onset of language disturbances can be in general temporally linked to the onset of seizures, their remission does not immediately follow the control of seizures or abolition of epileptiform activity with steroids or epilepsy surgery (see below).18  

Seizures are usually of mild severity and are often nocturnal; their clinical manifestations vary widely ranging from generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTC) to complex partial and simple partial seizures often displaying very subtle clinical signs such as brief clonic deviation of the eyes, at times associated with eye blinking, head dropping, and minor automatisms.18 Up to $20{-}30\%$ of patients with LKS are never found to have epileptic seizures8 and in some children seizures are identified for the first time in the course of a prolonged video-EEG monitoring study (V-EEG). Unlike the language disturbances, seizures tend to respond readily to pharmacotherapy with AEDs,8,9 and generally subside by the age of 15.19  

Behavior disturbances are very common in patients with LKS; their onset can precede, appear concurrently or follow the language disturbances. Motor hyperactivity, impulsivity and poor frustration tolerance are among the most frequently reported symptoms seen in up to $50\%$ of children8,9 and this cluster of symptoms is often indistinguishable from a severe Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). In a study of 18 children with LKS, Robinson et al.20 found behavioral disturbances in nine children, which was associated with frontal lobe discharges in awake EEGs.18 Sleep disturbances can also be common and present as difficulty falling asleep and/or middle of the night awakenings associated with bouts of screams and agitation.  

At the height of the auditory agnosia, some children have been reported to exhibit autistic-like features such as withdrawn and self-stimulatory behaviors. Nevertheless, children with LKS do not loose their social relatedness to others. Failure to recognize this important difference has resulted in the misdiagnosis of children with an ASD as suffering from LKS.  

Behavioral disturbances can often be extremely disruptive at home and in school often requiring the use of symptomatic treatment with psychotropic drugs, such as central nervous system stimulants (methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine), antipsychotic (risperidone, haloperidol, etc.) and antidepressant drugs (i.e., selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors [SSRI]) and alpha-adrenergic blockers such as clonidine, all of which have been found to yield mixed results. Behavioral disturbances can be expected to improve to various degrees in many but not all children following the remission of clinical seizures and/or of epileptiform activity on EEG recordings. Following epilepsy surgery, behavioral improvement can precede the recovery of language functions.  

## Pathophysiology  

The relationship between epileptiform activity and language disturbances has been considered as the ‘core’ pathogenic mechanism of LKS,1,12,18,21 but remains to be universally accepted by all investigators.22 Deonna reviewed the arguments both for and against the role of epileptic causality of language disturbances.21 Supportive evidence included speech recovery in some patients, coincident with the disappearance of EEG abnormalities when treated with steroid, antiepileptic agents or epilepsy surgery with multiple subpial transection (MST). Holmes et al.22 suggested that both the epileptic discharges and language disturbances were epiphenomena of underlying pathologic abnormalities in the speech areas. Arguments against an epileptic cause include the development of clinical seizures in some children long before or long after the onset of language dysfunction and the persistence of language disturbances after remission of electrographic epileptic activity. Additionally, some children never develop clinical seizures, although they typically do have abnormal EEG recordings with epileptiform activity.  

Morrell suggested the following hypothesis to explain the development of LKS:12,18  

It is well known that different neural systems have critical periods in development during which the adult patterns of synaptic engagement are gradually established. At such times, there is first a superabundant outgrowth of axon terminals resulting in a temporary hyper-innervation of the synaptic target; this extravagant outgrowth appears to be entirely under genetic control. Over the remainder of the critical period, the synaptic contacts are extensively pruned. The pruning is selective; it is dependent on and controlled by synaptic use, i.e., environmental input. Synaptic contacts activated by use become cemented, so to speak, while those not environmentally engaged wither away.23–29 Neural networks for linguistic function develop late and their circuitry remains malleable during the first 8 to 10 years of life.30–33 We hypothesize, then, that the impact of epileptic activity originating from this anlage of speech cortex may result in chaotic and behaviorally meaningless activation of synaptic contacts that would have been ‘pruned’ under normal circumstances. Such epileptic activity may set up permanent, inappropriate and nonfunctional linkages.  

Data from experimental studies in animals support Morrell’s hypothesis showing that epileptogenic lesions induced during a critical period for circuit development cause the emergence and fixation of long-lasting or permanent aberrant connections.34,35 Morrell’s hypothesis and the data of Baumabach and Chow34 and of Grigonis and Murphy35 provide an explanation for the development of language deficits associated with the temporal gap between the onset of epileptiform activity (and/or seizures) and the failure to regain language functions after remission of electrographic epileptiform activity.  

### Diagnostic evaluations  

An initial evaluation consists of a thorough and detailed clinical history aimed at identifying all the clinical signs and symptoms cited above and the temporal relation between the onset and course of language/behavioral disturbances and seizure activity. Auxiliary studies include a high resolution magnetic resonance imaging of the brain (MRI), an EEG study with awake and sleep recordings and a neuropsychological evaluation that includes a speech evaluation and evaluation of nonverbal cognitive functions.  

#### EEG studies as part of an initial evaluation  

As stated above, the CSWS pattern is the characteristic electrographic finding of LKS. It consists of runs of spike- and slow-wave that take up at least $80\%$ of slow-wave sleep and hence the EEG study has to be scheduled to be of long enough duration to record slow-wave sleep. This may be facilitated by the use of $25\mathrm{mgs}$ of amytriptyline in a single dose. The epileptiform activity presents typically as ‘apparent’ bisynchronous runs of spike- and slow-wave with a wide distribution maximal in posterotemporal regions (see Figure 43.1), but in some patients it may have a unilateral distribution.  

Mapping of the bisynchronous epileptiform activity can often reveal the unilateral source that propagates to the contralateral side with a 20–25 millisecond gap (see Figures 43.2a and 2b).12,18,36  

Awake electrographic recordings may show epileptiform discharges with a focal distribution in frontal, temporal or parietal regions and usually in a discontinuous pattern,18,19 though temporal spikes are most frequent. Background activity during wakefulness may be normal. Serial EEG recordings may vary within the same patient in the amount and degree of focality of epileptiform discharges.9 Furthermore, a normal sleep record does not necessarily rule out the diagnosis of LKS, as fluctuation in the severity of EEG abnormalities is a rather common finding. The absence of epileptiform activity may be often encountered in children with steroids or benzodiazepines, even in the absence of any clinical improvement.  

#### Electrophysiological studies as part of a presurgical evaluation  

Epilepsy surgery for the treatment of LKS follows the same principles that any other type of epilepsy surgery: there has to be concordance between interictal and ictal data obtained during V-EEG and with other neurophysiologic studies such as MEG. Thus, the first study is a V-EEG with scalp electrodes with the aim of identifying the presence of a sylvian dipole and establishing whether the epileptogenic zone extends beyond the intra and perisylvian region. In addition, the goal of the V-EEG is to identify clinical seizures that may have gone unrecognized up to then by the parents (up to $30\%$ of children with LKS are reported not to have seizures), because of their subtle clinical manifestations.  

#### Sylvian dipole  

As stated above, the mapping of epileptiform discharges with referential montages or with source localization programs can identify a dipole with negativity in the frontal regions and positive polarity in temporal electrodes.37 Thus the epileptiform discharges in LKS reflect a generator source represented by a tangential dipole in the inferior bank of the sylvian fissure (on the superior surface of the temporal lobe); therefore we refer to this pattern as the sylvian dipole. The search of a sylvian dipole must be done in the first discharge of a run of epileptiform discharges, as subsequent discharges may reflect the area of spread of the epileptic activity beyond the perisylvian area.  

#### Methohexital suppression test (MHXST)  

The vast majority of patients’ electrographic recordings reveal a CSWS pattern with ‘apparent’ bisynchronous discharges with a wide field of distribution but with maximal electronegativity in temporal lobe derivations. The onus of the electroencephalographer is to determine whether the epileptiform activity has a unilateral source within the sylvian region, or is of bilateral independent origin.

Figure 43.1 Electrographic pattern of CSWS.  

The use of methohexital (MHX) is aimed at identifying independent epileptiform activity within the CSWS; it is a barbiturate known to block excitatory synaptic transmission and, at low doses, to enhance inhibitory synaptic action.38,39 During intravenous infusion of MHX at doses high enough to cause electrocerebral silence, almost all excitatory transmission is abolished, with the exception of a few oligosynaptic systems with high safety factors, such as the direct thalamocortical relay (see Figures 43.3a and 3b). Under these circumstances, autonomous and truly independent epileptogenic lesions show a marked resistance to synaptic blockade and continue to fire; the epileptiform discharges stand out sharply against a flat EEG background.  

Conversely, epileptogenic lesions that are not independent and depend on synaptic input (i.e., epileptic discharges secondarily driven from a primary focus) are silenced along with the ongoing EEG rhythms.  

The MHX suppression test (MHXST) is carried out by administering the drug at a rate of $100\mathrm{mg/min}$ until a 60 s period of total electrocerebral suppression is reached. The test is carried out in the V-EEG monitoring unit at the patient’s bed side with an anaesthetist present, since at the deepest levels of MHX anaesthesia, a few minutes of apnoea occurs. The anaesthetist provides bag-breathing with room air. Intubation has never been necessary in more than 400 cases and the only morbidity has consisted of mild transient acceleration of the heart rate and transient hiccups.  

#### Magnetoencephalography studies  

In the last ten years, MEG has become one of the presurgical tests of LKS. MEG is sensitive to epileptic activity originating from the depths of sulci, such as the sylvian fissure, because it reveals magnetic fields generated by transmembrane synaptic currents oriented in a plane tangential to the skull surface.40–42 MEG performed on a small number of patients with LKS revealed a focus of epileptiform activity in the posterior temporal area adjacent to the sylvian fissure, supporting an origin in the dorsal surface of the superior temporal gyrus (see Figure 43.4a) and propagation to homotopic regions contralaterally (see Figure 43.4b).12,42  

The use of MEG has been useful in identifying children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ADS) that may have been misdiagnosed as LKS. Indeed, Lewine et al.40 compared the MEG data between six children with LKS and 50 children with ADS. In all the children with LKS, MEG revealed primary or secondary epileptiform involvement of the left intra/perisylvian region, with all but one child showing additional involvement of the right sylvian region. In all cases of LKS, independent epileptiform activity beyond the sylvian region was absent, although propagation of activity to frontal or parietal regions was seen occasionally. MEG identified epileptiform activity in 41 of the 50 $(82\%)$ children with an ASD that included intra/perisylvian regions in $85\%$ of the cases and

Figure 43.4 (a) MEG dipole co-registered on MRI reveals a right intrasylvian source of epileptic activity. (b) Red triangles indicate the source of the epileptic activity in the right sylvian cortex, while the blue triangles represent the propagated dipole to the contralateral side.  

$75\%$ of the ASD children with epileptiform activity demonstrated additional nonsylvian zones of independent epileptiform activity. Thus, this study documented the utility of MEG to identify different location(s) of epileptogenic zones in LKS and in ASD, as well as the different electrographic patterns of their recorded epileptiform activity.  

The valuable use of MEG has been reported in other small case series of LKS children. Thus, Pateau et al.41 carried out an MEG in four children. In all patients, the earliest spike activity originated in the intrasylvian cortex, spreading in one subject to the contralateral sylvian cortex within $20\mathrm{ms}$ . Secondary spikes occurred within $10{-}60\mathrm{ms}$ in ipsilateral perisylvian, temporo-occipital, and parietal-occipital areas. A single intrasylvian pacemaker initiated all epileptic activity in two patients, whereas the other two had independent left- and right-hemisphere circuits or focal spikes. MEG source dynamics predicted the results of the methohexital suppression test in two patients and was confirmed by surgery outcome in one patient, in whom all epileptic activity ceased after a small transection of the sylvian pacemaker.  

Sobel and colleagues found that 13 of 19 patients with LKS had perisylvian MEG spikes.42 In 10 of the patients, the spikes were bilateral, and in three they were unilateral. Four children had nonsylvian spikes. Interestingly enough, these children displayed various other behavior and cognitive dysfunction in addition to the aphasia, which questions their diagnosis of LKS and confirms the data reported by Lewine et al.  

#### V-EEG with intracranial recordings  

In the case of discordant data derived from MEG and scalpV-EEG or if lateralization of the source of epileptic activity cannot be achieved with non-invasive studies, repeat V-EEG with intracranial electrodes is considered. At the Rush Epilepsy Center, two or three pairs of eight contact epidural electrodes are used. These are placed parallel to the sylvian fissure, one about $1\mathrm{cm}$ . superior to the fissure, the second over the fissure and the third about $1\mathrm{cm}$ inferior to the fissure. A repeat MHXST is carried out with these electrodes and at the time of surgery, the electrodes contralateral to the side of surgery are kept in place for recording of the epileptiform activity throughout the procedure.  

### Neuroimaging studies  

#### MRI  

High resolution MRI studies must be carried out in all presurgical evaluations of LKS, as they may reveal subtle malformations of cortical development that may go undetected with standard MRI. In addition, this new technology lends itself to volumetric measurements of various neuroanatomical structures. A case in point is illustrated in a recently published study by Takeoka et al. who compared the cortical volume of the superior temporal areas corresponding to the auditory association cortex in four children with LKS and four children with other types of focal epilepsy.41 The authors divided the entire neocortex into parcellation units and counted the number of voxels in each parcellation unit. All children with LKS had a reduction of $36{-}51\%$ in the cortical volume of the superior temporal areas. It is not clear, however, whether the smaller volume reflects a cause or consequence of this disorder.  

Positron emission tomography studies (PET) have been carried out in a small number of patients with LKS. In studies performed in the awake state, PET with 2-[18F] fluoro-2-deoxy-Dglucose ( $^{\cdot_{18}}\mathrm{F}.$ -FDG) have shown an area of decreased blood flow or glucose utilization, while the opposite occurs when the radionucleotide is injected during slow wave sleep when recordings reveal a CSWS pattern. For example, Da Silva et al.,44 evaluated 17 children with LKS with 18-FDG PET; 15 out of the 17 patients had bitemporal glucose hypometabolism and in two the area of hypometabolism was unilateral. The patients were awake for the uptake period of FDG. On the other hand, studies done on sedated patients with induced continuous spike-and-wave discharges showed a focal area of increased blood flow or glucose utilization.12,45,46 Maquet and colleagues reported that some patients who underwent [18F]FDG-PET after the resolution of the active phase of spike-and-wave discharges showed persistent hypometabolism in the areas that previously showed hypermetabolism, documenting long-lasting metabolic alterations.45 Of note, areas of cortical hypermetabolism are not specific to LKS and can be seen as well in children with CSWS syndrome.46  

#### Neuropsychologic and speech evaluation  

The purpose of the neuropsychological and speech evaluations is twofold: to identify the type (i.e., expressive vs. receptive vs. both)  

and severity of language disturbances; and to establish whether cognitive problems are restricted to verbally mediated functions or if there is involvement of nonverbal cognitive functions. Two tests are typically (but not exclusively) used for evaluation of language functions. The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-revised (PPVT-R) is a measure of receptive vocabulary. During the test the child is asked to point to one of four pictures displayed on a card as depicting the word spoken by the examiner. The Expressive One Word Picture Vocabulary Test-revised (EOWPVT-R) is a test of expressive vocabulary. The child is shown a picture and asked to name it.  

The findings of neuropsychological testing have been associated with different discharge patterns of epileptiform activity. For example, Guilhoto and Morrell47 carried out a retrospective analysis of 19 cases referred with a presumptive diagnosis of LKS, and with the EEG pattern of CSWS. They separated the children into two groups: group 1 included those erroneously thought to have LKS (also known as ‘LKS-look-alikes’, $n=8$ ) and group 2 those with ‘true’ LKS (cognitive disturbances restricted to the verbal domains, $n=11$ ). Mapping of the distribution of electrical abnormality revealed that $6/8$ patients in Group I had widespread, multifocal discharge. One out of the eight cases had bilateral high parietal disturbance and 1/8 had a primarily left-sided abnormality that became bilateral and multifocal during slow-wave sleep. All of the patients in group 2 (11/11) showed discharges limited to the parietal-temporal region of both hemispheres which revealed the characteristic sylvian dipole with frontal negativity and temporal positivity, as described above.  

### Differential diagnosis  

The differential diagnosis of LKS includes CSWS syndrome, the ASDs and secondary aphasias.  

#### CSWS syndrome  

As stated above LKS is not the only epileptic encephalopathy with a CSWS electrographic pattern. The CSWS syndrome has been recognized as a distinct entity by the Commission on Classification and Terminology of the International League against Epilepsy (Commission on Classification and Terminology of the International League Against Epilepsy and by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10).2,48 This syndrome was initially described by Patry et al. in 1971 as ‘subclinical electrical status epilepticus during sleep’49 and then retitled by Tassinari as electrical status epileptic during sleep (ESES) in a report of six children, aged 7 to 12 years old, five of whom were mentally retarded and all exhibited language disturbances, epileptic seizures and very abnormal EEG recordings consistent with a CSWS pattern described above. The epileptic seizures were of various types including tonic, atonic, clonic, generalized tonico-clonic and atypical absences. The severity of mental retardation was related to the age of onset.48 Tassinari later changed the name of this syndrome to CSWS syndrome.3  

The following differences between LKS and the CSWS syndrome can be identified based on data from publications by Beaumanoir50 and Bureau,51,52 that included analyses of clinical and electrographic findings in 71 children with LKS and 103 children with CSWS syndrome. Landau-Kleffner syndrome tends to affect a slightly younger population, presenting first with language dysfunction and behavioral deterioration. In CSWS syndrome, the affected children tend to be slightly older, presenting with more global neuropsychologic and behavioral deterioration in addition to the language dysfunction.51,52 The severity of the seizures and EEG abnormality are more pronounced in CSWS syndrome in which seizures are more likely to be significantly more frequent of all types including atonic seizures with falls, absence and atypical absences, GTC and hemiclonic seizures. The spike-and-wave discharges are maximal in the centro-temporal or posterior temporal regions in LKS and in the frontal head region in CSWS syndrome. The seizures in CSWS syndrome are often difficult to control, primarily among the subgroup of patients with atypical absence seizures and drop attacks which are resistant to treatment with AEDs. The patients with CSWS syndrome had more frequent MRI abnormalities $(33\%)$ than children with LKS $(13\%)$ . Interestingly enough, seizure remission was comparable between the two groups after resolution of the CSWS pattern.49,52  

Autistic spectrum disorders are behaviorally defined syndromes with various etiologies that are manifested by deficits in verbal and nonverbal communication, social interaction deficits and repetitive behaviors or a restrictive array of interests.53 About $30\%$ of children with ASD experience a language regression and one-third develop epilepsy by the time they reach adolescence.54 Furthermore, interictal epileptiform discharges in centro-temporal regions have been identified in a certain percentage of children with ASD that never go on to experience clinical seizures.54,55 Recently, the term of autistic epileptiform regression has been coined to refer to children with autistic regression in the context of an epileptiform EEG.  

Tuchman54 has investigated the association of epileptic seizures and language regression in 585 children with ASD. No difference was found in seizure occurrence between the children with or without language regression. On the other hand, the EEG recordings of children with language regression were significantly more likely to exhibit interictal epileptiform discharges ( $14\%$ vs. $6\%$ , $p=0.02\$ ).  

In contrast to LKS, a normal development of language cannot be traced in many children with ASD. Rapin53 has also suggested that in patients with reported ‘normal’ language development, a careful history may in fact reveal that such was not the case. As stated above, a review of family video tapes may help the speech pathologist establish whether the child already exhibited a developmental delay before the ‘more overt’ evidence of language deterioration was identified by parents. Children with ASD have been found to exhibit a compromised drive to communicate, difficulty with comprehension of gestures, facial expression and tone of voice and immediate echolalia (pronoun reversal) delayed echolalia (scripts, formulaic speech) and perseveration. In addition they display self-stimulatory behavior, marked difficulty with adjusting to minimal changes and loss of social relatedness.53,56 From a cognitive standpoint, these children display across the board cognitive deficits.  

The differential diagnosis of LKS also includes differentiation with developmental language disorders with or without an epileptiform EEG, which consist of lack of development of age appropriate language skills in an otherwise cognitively and behaviorally normal child.54 Finally, since hearing difficulties may present as apparent language impairment, auditory function should be assessed by behavioral and/or electrophysiological means.  

### Nonsurgical treatment  

#### Pharmacologic treatment  

There is a dichotomy in the response to AEDs of clinical seizures and language disturbances. Indeed, remission of clinical seizures is readily achieved in a majority of patients, while the opposite is true when it comes to cognitive disturbances. Often, the improvement of language functions may be more an expression of a spontaneous remission than a real therapeutic effect of AEDs, above all in the early phases of the disease. Furthermore, due to the rarity of the disorder controlled clinical trials have not been done.  

Pharmacologic treatment of LKS has included trials with AEDs, steroids and IV immunoglobulin (IVIG).  

#### Antiepileptic drugs  

Using the trial and error approach some investigators have suggested that AEDs like valproic acid (VPA) benzodiazepines and ethosuximide can yield (at least partially and/or temporarily) a therapeutic impact in both language and seizure disturbances while carbamazepine, and phenytoin can worsen the course of LKS.57 In fact these two AEDs were found to increase the duration of spike-wave activity in sleep; phenobarbital was thought to have no therapeutic effect on language functions but to worsen the child’s behavioral problems.  

In most cases an initial trial with valproic acid is usually carried out before trying any of the other AEDs. Clobazam has been reported to significantly reduce continuous spike-wave discharges in several small studies, associated with language improvement.57,58 Vigabatrin,59 felbamate,60 lamotrigine, and recently levetiracetam have also been reported as effective as well.  

Diazepam has been successfully tried in the management of language and behavioral disturbances in children with LKS. In a protocol that calls for the administration of rectal diazepam (Diastat ${\mathfrak{B}}^{\cdot}$ ) at a dose of $\mathrm{{1mg/kg}}$ under V-EEG on day one, Riviello et al. have found suppression or reduction of the epileptiform activity associated with an improvement of language functions in a small group of children with LKS. The child is then placed on a maintenance oral dose of $0.5\mathrm{mg/kg/day}$ and kept on this dose for three to six months (Riviello $J J,$ unpublished data). In the case of bisynchronous epileptiform activity, the administration of rectal diazepam resulted in suppression of the propagation of the epileptiform activity to the side contralateral to the seizure focus (Kanner, unpublished data).  

#### Steroids  

The use of steroids in LKS has included trials with prednisone and ACTH. Oral prednisone has been given as daily doses or as pulse doses on a weekly basis to minimize potential adverse events. Trials have ranged from 3–6months to long-term trials, depending on clinical response, tolerability and the preferences of individual centers. Some reports have suggested a favorable acute and long-term response of short and longterm duration.62–64  

The use of ACTH calls for $80\mathrm{U}/$ day with a three-month taper. Most centers have preferred the use of oral prednisone. At the Rush Epilepsy Center, it is started at a dose of $2{-}3\mathrm{mg/kg/}$ day and tapered down over the course of 3 months. The trial of prednisone may be extended at minimal effective doses, provided that the child has derived a significant improvement in language function and in the absence of significant adverse events such as behavioral problems (such as aggressive behavior, motor hyperactivity, impulsivity (beyond that already caused by the LKS), sleep disturbances, hypertension, diabetes, obesity. Long-term use of steroids can be frequently associated with the risk of developing the above-cited problems in addition to a Cushingoid appearance, cataracts and osteopenia/ osteoporosis.  

Sinclair and Snyder62 recently reported on their experience with long-term steroid therapy in eight children with LKS and two with CSWS; three were females and seven males and the age of onset ranged from 2–11 years (mean 7.5 years). The patients received prednisone $\mathrm{1mg/kg/day}$ for 6 months, 1 year, then yearly. After a mean follow-up period of 4 years (range 1–10 years), all but one patient manifested significant improvement in language, cognition, and behavior, which persisted after discontinuation of steroids. Side-effects were reported in four patients and were transient; they included weight gain (2), behavioral change (1), and hypertension (1). Tsuru et al.63 have reported on the use of high-dose IV steroids in two children with LKS. Both patients were treated with highdose methylprednisolone sodium succinate $20\mathrm{mg/kg}$ daily) for three consecutive days. This infusion was repeated three times with a 4-day interval between treatments, which resulted in a rapid improvement in speech ability. After intravenous therapy, prednisolone was given orally ( $\mathrm{\Delta2mg/kg}$ daily for 1 month, then gradually withdrawn), which maintained the clinical improvement in language functions. Lerman et al.64 reported on the treatment of four children with LKS with early and prolonged ACTH or corticosteroid therapy, with high initial doses. In all four cases the EEG promptly became normal, with subsequent long-lasting remission of the aphasia and improvement of seizure control. Three to 6 years after discontinuation of hormone therapy the children were off medication and free from seizures and language disability. Marescaux58 treated three children with LKS with steroid therapy which resulted in improved speech, suppression of seizures, and normalization of the EEG in the three. These authors advocated the administration of corticosteroids in high doses as soon as the diagnosis is established and to maintain on these doses for several months or years to avoid symptom recurrence.  

While steroid therapy is the pharmacologic treatment most likely to yield to significant improvement in language disturbances, its discontinuation is often followed by symptom recurrence or loss of gains made. For example, in a study of 22 children with LKS evaluated at the Rush Epilepsy Center,4 20 underwent a trial with prednisone. Nine of these children $(45\%)$ regained functional language but steroids had to be discontinued because of adverse events. Of note, a recovery of functional language with steroids was a predictor of a recovery of functional language six months after epilepsy surgery.  

#### Intravenous immunoglobulin  

The use of IVIG has been reported in isolated cases or small patient series. Mikati et al.65 reported the first case of a  

31-month-old child with LKS treated with IV IG 500mg/day for 4 days followed by remission of language disturbances and electrographic epileptiform activity. In one series of 11 patients, however, only two patients had long-lasting improvement of language functions.66  

Clearly, pharmacotherapy of LKS has been disappointing with respect to the treatment of language disturbances, either because of lack of efficacy (of AEDs) or significant adverse events (of steroid therapy).  

### Surgical treatment  

#### When should surgery be considered for the treatment of LKS?  

The role of surgical treatment of LKS continues to be a source of debate among epileptologists and pediatric neurologists with some advocating18,67 and others questioning it.68 The aim of epilepsy surgery for LKS is to yield a remission of the language disturbances and render the patient free of any clinical seizures. In most patients, the latter goal can usually be reached with AEDs, thus the most frequent reason to consider the surgical option is to achieve the former aim. The authors that favor the use of epilepsy surgery base their decision on the favorable results of this treatment modality in a group of children in whom less aggressive treatments are not an option. Thus, in 1995, Morrell et al.18 published the first series of 14 children with LKS who underwent surgical treatment consisting of MST of the epileptogenic area localized in intra and perisylvian cortex. Morrell’s rationale for suggesting the use of MST in LKS included the following arguments: (1) children with LKS whose language disturbances failed to remit spontaneously after one year or longer were unlikely to have functional language in adulthood. (2) Pharmacotherapy with AEDs is more often than not unlikely to yield a remission of language disturbances, while therapy with steroids may result in significant improvement but is associated with potentially serious long-term adverse events. (3) The surgical technique MST was developed with the specific aim of abolishing epileptic activity from eloquent cortex. Thus, Morrell and his group suggested that epilepsy surgery could be considered in children with LKS that had failed to regain functional language for a period of at least 2 years despite multiple pharmacologic trials with AEDs and steroid therapy. The authors that oppose the consideration of surgery in LKS have questioned the effectiveness of MST which they claim ‘does not substantiate the perioperative complications’. This section of the article will address this dilemma.  

#### Experience from previous case series  

In their case series of 14 children with LKS, Morrell et al.18 found that seven children exhibited significant improvement of language functions, with four additional children having some improvement. Among the three children in whom the surgical procedure had no impact, two had bilateral independent (ictal) foci and below age appropriate nonverbal cognitive functions, while one child was found to have a focal Rasmussen’s encephalitis. In a subsequent study, Grote et al.69 reported on the language changes established with neuropsychological testing following MST in 14 children with LKS,  

10 of whom were part of the initial series and four patients that had undergone surgery since the publication of the initial case series. Eleven of the 14 children exhibited significant postoperative improvement on measures of expressive or receptive vocabulary, but only four $(29\%)$ were in a regular class without receiving any special services at school. Grote identified a positive correlation between the pre- to postsurgical scores and the postsurgical follow-up duration. In contrast to observations made by Bishop13 and Dulac14 in nonsurgical case series, age of onset of LKS was not predictive of language recovery after surgery. On the other hand, Grote et al. found an inverse correlation between the time elapsed between onset of LKS symptoms and time of surgery and language improvement.  

Irwin70 reported a series of five children with LKS who underwent MST at Guy’s Hospital in London. All five children experienced a significant improvement of language functions, but none had achieved an age-appropriate level. The CSWS pattern that was present in all patients before surgery was eliminated after MST.  

The different postsurgical language outcome between Grote’s69 and Irwin’s studies can be explained by a longer postsurgical follow-up in Grote’s study, as he clearly demonstrated a correlation between degree of language improvement and duration of postsurgical follow-up. The second difference may reside in an earlier surgical intervention after the start of symptoms in Grote’s study, as he shows an inverse relationship between recovery of receptive language functions and time between onset of symptoms to surgery. This observation seems to be in agreement with Irwin’s observations made by his colleagues at Guy’s hospital.20 Indeed in a study of $18~\mathrm{chil}.$ - dren with LKS followed up for $67\pm46$ months, five of whom were treated with $\mathrm{MST^{70}}$ and 13 with only pharmacotherapy, recovery of language functions either spontaneously or after pharmacotherapy or MST seemed to be unlikely after 3 years of a CSWS pattern.  

In addition to MST, temporal lobectomy has been used for the treatment of LKS. Cole et al.71 reported two patients with LKS both of whom were mute prior to surgery. One patient was speaking in full sentences after 10 months. The patient experienced a recurrence of language disturbances and was lost to follow-up. The second patient had surgery as an adult by which time she had learned to communicate by sign language. One year after surgery her language functions had improved but were not normal.  

As with any type of epilepsy surgery, the proper selection of surgical candidates is of the essence to ensure a successful postsurgical outcome. Unfortunately, the total number of surgeries performed so far is too small to generate analyzable data that can help identify the variables associated with the best postsurgical outcome. Based on the experience of the first 14 patients operated at the Rush Epilepsy Center, Morrell et al.16 concluded that the ideal surgical candidates are children that meet the following criteria: (1) acute (or sometimes stuttering) onset of aphasia and auditory agnosia in an otherwise normal child who has already developed age-appropriate language; (2) failure to show any signs of improvement of linguistic functions for 2 years; (3) severe, clearly epileptiform, EEG abnormality characterized by unilateral or bilateral spike-wave discharge in slow-wave sleep; (4) electrophysiological evidence of a unilateral origin of the bilateral epileptiform discharge; (5) neuropsychological test findings indicating relative preservation of nonverbal cognitive capacities in the presence of devastating loss of verbal skills. Of note, the presence of clinical seizures is not mandatory. Morrell made a point of emphasizing the risk of considering surgery in children with the ‘LKS-like’ diagnoses, which in reality are likely to be suffering from a pervasive developmental disorder.  

### Surgical technique  

#### Multiple subpial transection  

#### Why MST?  

In 1995 Morrell et al.18 suggested using MST for the treatment of LKS, since this is a surgical technique developed with the aim of eliminating epileptic activity from eloquent cortex (i.e., language cortex) without interfering with its function. The technique is based on the following three principles: (1) interruption of intracortical horizontal fibers which are necessary for the propagation and synchronous discharge of epileptic activity without which a seizure cannot occur.72,73 (2) The preservation of the vertical columnar organization of the cortex which constitutes the basic functional unit of cortical physiology.74–77 (3) Transections done at $5\mathrm{mm}$ intervals throughout the epileptogenic area, since the critical mass of cortex for synchronization of epileptiform discharges is at least $5\mathrm{mm}$ .78  

#### Operative procedure  

As stated above, the typical source of epileptic activity involves intrasylvian cortex only or in conjunction with perisylvian cortex, though in occasional cases an additional epileptogenic area has been identified in frontal and anterolateral cortex. Accordingly, the extent of the craniotomy is aimed at exposing the sylvian fissure, anterior and posterior language areas, including the angular and supramarginal gyrus. Opening of the sylvian fissure must always precede any MST of perisylvian cortex as the edema ensuing from MST may make the opening of the sylvian fissure more difficult (see Figure 43.5). The location and extent of the opening of the sylvian fissure is based primarily on MEG data.  

Transections are carried out with a transection hook, which has a handle, a malleable shaft and a tip that is $4\mathrm{mm}$ long (which parallels the cortical width) and $1\mathrm{mm}$ in width. The tip has been designed to be blunt and angled at a $105^{\circ}$ in order to minimize the risk of snagging or injuring vessels (see Figure 43.6).18,79  

In general, the cortex accessible for transection is limited to the crown of the gyrus, while that at the depth of the sulcus remains outside of the transected cortex. The gyral cortical pattern is fairly constant among individuals, but the microgyral pattern of individual gyri may vary considerably. Accordingly, a careful inspection of each of the gyri, its microgyral pattern and vascular supply is of the essence before the transections are carried out. Transections are done perpendicular to the long axis of the gyrus at $5\mathrm{mm}$ intervals. They are first performed in the more dependent areas to avoid the problem of subarachnoid blood obscuring the other areas. At the edge of the visible gyrus, in an avascular area, a 20-gauge needle is used to open a hole in the pia, through which the tip of the transector is introduced into the gray matter layer and advanced to the next sulcus in a direction perpendicular to the long axis of the gyrus. At the Rush Epilepsy Center, the neurosurgeon keeps the tip of the transector upward and visible immediately below the pia. At other centers, neurosurgeons have elected to introduce the transector with the tip oriented downwards with positive outcomes.80 It is important that the pia be left undisturbed to minimize vascular injury and scarring. Furthermore it is essential that the surgeon keep the $4\mathrm{mm}$ tip of the transector within the gray matter layer to ensure that the white matter is undisturbed. Once the epileptogenic area is transected, the transection lines take on a striped appearance from the petechial hemorrhages along the way (see Figure 43.7).

The technique of MST appears to be relatively simple to the observer. Yet, it is more complicated than it actually appears, as transections must be done perpendicular to the cortical surface, not an easy achievement, given the variable microgyral patterns that can result in oblique or parallels transections.81,82 Needless to say there is a learning curve in the acquisition of these skills. To that end, neurosurgeons are encouraged to carry out transections in brains of cadavers or in cortical tissues destined to be resected (i.e., antero-temporal resections) and examine the transected tissue under the microscope.

#### Anesthesia  

At the Rush Epilepsy Center surgery has been carried out under general anaesthesia with MHX. While this drug can activate interictal epileptiform activity, activation is restricted to the epileptogenic zone.83–87 Enflurane or isoflurane are avoided as anaesthetic agents at our centre, since the latter has been reported to suppress epileptiform activity in $26\%$ of patients while enflurane can activate epileptiform discharges beyond the area of the epileptogenic focus in $30\%$ .88  

#### Intraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG)  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/75aecc13-d94b-498f-a57b-d2c2317b2c13/49019a6c2d447f7e707b6edbd7de2a648ff0038968282b4f5c27d77c2c964e58.jpg)  
Figure 43.8 Electrodes typically used for intraoperative electrocorticography after the opening of the sylvian fissure.  

Once exposure of perisylvian cortex and opening of the sylvian fissure are achieved ECoG is carried out to guide the extent of the transacted area. Mapping includes localization of the source of epileptic discharges, and the central sulcus. The central sulcus is identified by the recording of evoked potentials to electrical stimulation of median nerve, which aides in the localization of the pre- and postcentral gyri. Identification of the source of the epileptogenic area with ECoG is based on a spatial-temporal analysis of epileptiform discharges in which the onus on the electroencephalographer is to identify those spikes originating within ‘abnormal cortex’ (as evidenced by the presence of abundant focal slow-wave activity) that propagate to adjacent and/or distant cortical regions. It is therefore essential that electrodes cover the areas suspected to be the potential source of epileptic activity (i.e., planum temporale and superior cortical surface within the sylvian fissure and at times, perisylvian cortex) and areas of propagation (i.e., temporal lateral, frontal-lateral and perisylvian cortex). To that end, a 20-electrode pad is moved throughout the exposed lateral convexity of the hemisphere; in addition, one or two six-contact strips are placed within the sylvian fissure, three contacts covering the inferior and three the superior cortical areas (see Figure 43.8). On occasions, additional six-contact cylindrical electrode strips are used for coverage of subtemporal, mesial frontal and mesial parietal cortex.  

The locations of pre- and postcentral gyri are ticketed. The extent of the epileptogenic area to be transacted is demarcated with an easily visible thread. Photographs are taken prior to, and following, the last transaction, so that reconstruction of the transected areas could be made. It is important to emphasize that opening of the sylvian fissure can be associated with technical difficulties in some children. Furthermore, in some children the source of the epileptiform activity can be established to be intrasylvian (i.e., before it propagates to perisylvian cortex) but no discrete source can be identified ‘within’ the exposed intrasylvian cortex; in such cases, the neurosurgeon needs to expand the opening of the sylvian fissure and transect both superior and inferior cortical surfaces in toto. Following a successful MST, the background activity of the transected cortex is expected to be attenuated.  

Some epilepsy centers using MST, rely on extra operative data in determining the extent of the area to be transected. In our opinion, Intraoperative ECoG is of the essence prior to and following the transections, as epileptiform activity may not be necessarily abolished. Indeed, it is important to remember that only the cortex at the crowns of the gyri is usually accessible for transection, while the sulci remain untouched. Additional transections may be necessary in some cases after the initial ones fail to abolish the epileptiform discharges, in which case the possibility that these discharges are originating from a distant cortex or from within the depth of a sulcus should be considered. In order to transect the depth of a sulcus safely, the tip of the transector should be turned away from the sulcus as the instrument is advanced. Without post-transection ECoG, the neurosurgeon may not know whether the transection achieved the intended goal.  

### Results of MST  

The interpretation of the surgical outcome of previously published surgical series has to take into account several methodological problems among which the most important include the small numbers and the inclusion of cases that may not meet the original diagnostic criteria of LKS. To overcome the first problem, multicenter studies using the same diagnostic protocols, inclusion criteria for surgery and surgical technique is necessary given that classic LKS is a rare disorder. To overcome the second problem, we reviewed the surgical outcome of children who met the classic diagnostic criteria and who underwent epilepsy surgery at the Rush Epilepsy Center4 between the years 1990 and 2003.  

This study included 22 children, 14 boys and eight girls who were $6.95\pm1.95$ years old at the time of surgery. The mean age of onset of LKS was $4.3\pm1.4$ and the mean duration of the disease before surgery was $2.5\pm1.3$ years. Among the 22 children, 21 had nonfunctional language for a period of at least 18 months; one child had functional language but had been experiencing frequent and recurrent language regressions that failed to be prevented with pharmacotherapy with AEDs and steroids. The mean baseline score of the language test used for evaluation of expressive vocabulary, the Expressive One Word Picture Vocabulary Test-revised (EOWPVT-R) [expressed as age equivalent in months old] was $12.8\pm9.0$ months, while the mean baseline score of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-revised (PPVT-R) which is used for evaluation of receptive language was $14.6\pm12.9$ months. Behavioral problems were reported in 19 children; four children had an abnormal MRI and three had never experienced any clinical seizures.  

Among these 22 children, presurgical data obtained with noninvasive tests were sufficient to proceed to surgery, while in eight patients V-EEG with bilateral intracranial epidural electrodes as described above had to be carried out. In twelve patients $(54.5\%)$ ) only MST was carried out in intra- and or perisylvian cortex. In seven $(32\%)$ a combination of MST and resection of temporal lobe structures were carried out, while three children underwent a pure resection of the planum temporale.  

Postsurgical neuropsychological and speech evaluation was carried out after a mean period of $34.1\pm19.9$ (7–75 months). At that point, the mean EOWPVT and PPVT scores were $144\pm$ 72.9 months and $144\pm73.8$ months, respectively $\mathit{\Pi}_{\mathcal{P}}<0.0001$ for both analyses) with mean gains of $124\pm60.1$ months and $129\pm59.2\$ months, respectively. A significant correlation between improvement in the scores of these two tests was found $r=0.86$ , $\begin{array}{r}{p\ <\ 0.0001\rangle}\end{array}$ ). There was a significant correlation between the duration of postsurgical follow-up and the gains made on the PPVT $_{r=0.56}$ , $p=0.02\$ ) and a statistical trend for the EOWPVT $\overset{\cdot}{r}=0.4$ , $p=0.09.$ ). At that point in time, 20 of the 22 patients were still receiving speech therapy. Following a mean postsurgical follow-up period of $48.3\pm30.2\$ months, 16 children $(72\%)$ had regained functional language as defined by the ability to use complex sentences and understand what was being said to them. Despite these significant gains, only nine of these children $(41\%)$ were in a regular class without a need of assistance or further speech therapy.  

Among the 19 children with clinical seizures before surgery, 15 $(79\%)$ ) had become seizure free, two had rare seizures, one had ${>}90\%$ and one had ${<}90\%$ seizure frequency reduction. Of note, residual spikes at the end of ECoG and at the last EEG were not associated with a worse postsurgical outcome. Behavioral improvement was reported in 17 of the 19 patients $(89.5\%)$ .  

Prior to surgery, a trial with prednisone was carried out in 20 children, nine of whom regained functional language defined by the ability to use sentences to express themselves. Response to prednisone was a predictor of functional language at 6 months after surgery, but not at the last follow-up.  

#### Morbidity  

Two patients sustained small infarcts caused by vascular manipulation, probably at the time of opening the sylvian fissure. These took place among the first cases in whom the opening of the fissure was done. In one patient, the infarct involved the posterior white matter and was not associated with any clinical deficits. The second patient had weakness of the right arm which cleared over a three-month period.  

## Conclusions  

The data presented here suggest that MST can be an effective therapy for children with LKS who, after losing linguistic abilities, have failed to show any signs of improvement for at least 18 months to 2 years. However, not every child with a severe form of LKS may benefit from this surgery. We believe that demonstration of a unilateral, well-localized, source of the epileptic activity and a relative preservation of nonverbal cognitive functions in children who had a normal development of language functions are prerequisites for surgical consideration. The positive response to steroids in a significant percentage of children (9 of 20 in our study) raises the question of what criteria should be followed in the selection of surgery versus pharmacotherapy with steroids. No definite answer is available as no head-to-head comparison has been carried out between these two treatment modalities. In our center, surgery was considered for children who had not responded to steroids and in children who had responded but had experienced adverse events which precluded their long-term use. Thus, until the safety and efficacy of these two treatment modalities are compared in multicenter, randomized controlled head-to-head study, surgery should be considered in children with LKS who are not candidates for pharmacotherapy with either AEDs or steroid therapy.

## Introduction  

Historically the Lennox–Gastaut syndrome is a generalised epilepsy. In the last international classification of epileptic syndromes and epilepsies,1 it is listed as ‘cryptogenic or symptomatic generalized epilepsy’. That means it is usually related to a known or suspected disorder of the central nervous system. In the new proposal published in $2001^{2}$ it is listed under the heading of ‘epileptogenic encephalopathy’ which means a condition in which the epileptiform abnormalities themselves are believed to contribute to the progressive disturbance in cerebral function. Before discussing whether and when it could be considered as surgically remediable, I will briefly describe the syndrome.  

### Description  

Among childhood epilepsies, the Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is one of the most severe epileptic syndromes, due to the frequency of seizures, the occurrence of sudden falls, a marked pharmacoresistency, and the occurrence of mental and behavioral disturbances.3 The physiopathogenic mechanisms of LGS are not well understood and the borderlines with other types of severe epilepsies are not easy to define. Without a precise knowledge of the clinical and electroencephalographic (EEG) characteristics of the patient concerned, it may be difficult to distinguish between LGS and other childhood epilepsies such as the Doose syndrome (myoclonic-astatic epilepsy), epilepsy with continuous spikeand-waves (SWs) during slow sleep, and focal epilepsies with bilateral secondary synchrony.  

LGS is defined by several criteria:  

1. polymorphous epileptic seizures, with mainly atypical absences, axial tonic and atonic seizures;   
2. EEG patterns consisting of diffuse slow SWs and bursts of fast rhythms at $10{\mathrm{-}}12\operatorname{Hz}$ during sleep; and   
3. permanent psychological disturbances with psychomotor delay or personality disorders or both.  

However, other seizure types can be seen (myoclonic, focal, generalized tonic-clonic). The seizure frequency is high and they often repeat themselves in episodes of status. Focal and multifocal abnormalities can be associated with diffuse slow SWs in the EEG. These electroclinical features can occur in a previously normal child, without pathological antecedents and without signs of brain lesion, usually between 1 and 8 years (constituting the cryptogenic form of LGS). They also can occur in a child with prior signs of brain damage, sometimes following another type of epilepsy, such as West’s syndrome or a focal epilepsy (symptomatic form). In the latter, the age at onset can cover a wider range (between 1 and 15 years).  

Etiological circumstances are various; ante-, peri- or postnatal: anoxo-ischemia, vascular accident, cerebral and cerebromeningeal infection, hemiconvulsion-hemiplegia-epilepsy syndrome, brain malformation and migration disorders, tuberous sclerosis, Down’s syndrome, hydrocephalus, head trauma, brain tumor, radiotherapy for brain tumor. Neuroimaging studies show abnormalities related to etiology. In some cases, in spite of a psychomotor retardation before the onset of seizures, or of a cerebral atrophy demonstrated by computerized tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), there is no recognizable etiology. When epilepsy starts in the first year of life, it is often in the form of West’s syndrome, followed by LGS. Otherwise the LGS can be preceded by focal seizures or can have the full-blown presentation from the very onset on. The typical features of LGS can be observed only transiently in some patients. In the cryptogenic forms, there is by definition no recognized etiology.  

The underlying mechanisms are still unknown.4 Pathologic studies are rare. They have shown anomalies mainly at the synaptic and postsynaptic levels: selective neuronal necrosis,5 poor dendritic arborization and disturbed synaptic development,6 perhaps related to an autoimmune process, also hypothesized by Eeg-Olofsson.7 However, the immunologic approach8 did not reach significant results. Even the neurophysiological pathways leading to the expression of generalized slow SWs on the scalp are not explained. The same processes as in the idiopathic generalized epilepsies could play a limited part, since abnormal sleep patterns seem to originate outside the usual thalamo-cortical circuit.9 Secondary bilateral synchrony could be at the origin of the apparently generalized EEG changes. Recently, Bonnani et al.10 have demonstrated that the spikes preceding the myoclonic jerks in the LGS were propagated from one frontal lobe, unlike in the idiopathic myoclonic astatic epilepsy where they were diffusely distributed without lateralization. LGS seems to be one specific age-dependent condition which looks like a diffuse encephalopathy, and we do not know the reason why it appears in either normal or brain-damaged patients.4 However, LGS is not as strictly age-dependent as  

West syndrome. When it has started in childhood it may continue in adulthood, and it may appear at various ages, from baby to adolescent and, exceptionally, to adult.  

### Ictal symptomatology  

Tonic seizures constitute one of the main signs of this syndrome. They are axial, axial and proximal, or global, and symmetrical or asymmetrical. They involve sudden flexion of the neck and body, raising the arms in a semi-flexed or extended position, extension of the legs, contraction of the facial muscles, sometimes restricted to the lower lip, rolling the eyes, apnea and facial flushing. Enuresis can occur and pupils are usually dilated. This can lead to sudden falling. Loss of consciousness does not occur in all instances. Return to normal consciousness is always concomitant with the end of the EEG discharge. They are diurnal and nocturnal. During sleep, they are often short, with only rolling of the eyes and change in the respiratory rhythm, and they can escape attention. Alternatively, when they are long, they can culminate in a tremor pattern. In other cases they can be followed by a phase of gestural automatisms.  

On the EEG, the tonic seizures correspond to a discharge of bilateral rapid rhythms, of variable voltage, higher in the anterior areas and in the vertex, sometimes preceded by a short flattening of the background, and followed by diffuse slow-waves or spike-waves (Figure 44.1). There is no postictal silence.  

Atypical absences are also observed in the majority of cases. Often they are difficult to clinically detect because they begin and end progressively, and the loss of consciousness is incomplete. Eyelids and perioral myoclonias and drooling are usual. Decrease in muscle tone of variable intensity can lead either to a progressive head drop or complete fall (‘atonic absences’).  

On the EEG, atypical absences correspond to irregular, diffuse slow spike-waves, at $2{-}2.5\mathrm{Hz}$ , more or less symmetrical, difficult to differentiate from the interictal slow spike-waves (Figure 44.2).  

The third characteristic seizure type is represented by the drop attacks. This term is only phenomenological and does not correspond to an epileptic seizure type. It designates all the sudden falls, whatever their mechanism: atonic, myoclonic, myoclonoatonic or tonic, which are often impossible to distinguish without a video and polygraphic EEG recording (Figure 44.3). They correspond to various EEG patterns which can be combined: brief flattening, diffuse poly-SW or fast rhythms. It has been demonstrated that drop attacks were mainly due to a tonic mechanism.11,12 However, in the literature the term ‘atonic seizures’ is often used to designate seizures with sudden fall without any demonstration of the mechanism responsible for the fall. That is confusing, and it is preferable to use ‘drop attacks’.  

All these types of seizures can be repeated in status, particularly atypical absences and tonic seizures.  

Seizures of other types, not typical for the syndrome, focal and generalized tonic clonic, are observed in some patients.  

### Interictal symptomatology  

#### Clinical  

There is no neurological sign specific to LGS and those signs observed in some patients are due to the previous brain lesion in the symptomatic forms (hemiparesia).  

Cognitive impairment and personality disorders are constant but different in the cryptogenic and in the symptomatic forms. In the latter they are often pre-existing to the LGS onset and will worsen during the course of the syndrome. In the former, the first changes seem to be slowness in the ideation and verbal expression. In children aged three to five, slow psychomotor development, instability and behavioral disorders occur. In older children, attention disorders preclude satisfactory school work and make further learning difficult or even impossible. Relationships with other children and adults are distorted by the high frequency of seizures, associated with slowness, verbal and comprehension difficulties, which results in aggressiveness and a tendency to isolation. Personality disorders are nearly always present and, sometimes, evolve to a psychotic organization.

Figure 44.2 Atypical absence recorded in a 6-year-old boy, with diffuse SW of irregular frequency. There is no difference with the nterictal discharge on the right of the figure.  

### Electroencephalography  

In awake patients, the EEG is abnormal in most cases, even in the early stages of the disease. Background activity is often slow and poorly structured with regards to the patient age. Interictal discharges of diffuse slow SWs, at $2{-}2.5\mathrm{Hz}.$ , widespread over the two hemispheres, are recorded, isolated or grouped in bursts of variable duration, facilitated by hyperpnea (Figure 44.2). They can be associated to focal or multifocal slow waves, spikes and SWs, predominating in the fronto-temporal areas. Intermittent photic stimulation usually has no effect.  

During sleep, cyclic organization remains normal or shows a decrease in the REM phases. Diffuse slow spikewaves become more and more repeated and their morphology changes, giving an aspect of poly-SW (Figure 44.4). Then they start with brief bursts of rapid rhythms, at ${\tt l}0\mathrm{Hz},$ of high amplitude. There is no striking difference between these subclinical discharges and those accompanied by clinical manifestations. It is important to emphasize that these discharges are the main diagnostic criterion for LGS.

## Treatment  

Treatment is disappointing. Seizures do not respond or respond transitorily to the antiepileptic drugs. Carbamazepine, valproate, and the benzodiazepines are useful. Results have also been obtained with some new drugs, such as vigabatrin, lamotrigine, felbamate, topiramate, and zonisamide (in Japan), but many patients are not improved by these drugs. Corticosteroids and immunotherapy can help at the onset or in worsening periods. Ketogenic diet has been used with satisfactory results in some patients.  

### Is LGS a surgically remediable syndrome?  

According to its electroclinical characteristics LGS seems not to be considered for surgery. However, seizures are usually extremely pharmacoresistant, EEGs show numerous discharges and cognitive functioning gradually declines. Thus, it is legitimate to search for a surgical approach. Two situations in which LGS may be surgically remediable may be considered.  

#### Surgically removable lesions  

In the first situation, the patient presents with a known etiology consisting of a localized and well circumscribed lesion. In that case the removal of this lesion is able to make seizures disappear, EEG improves and behavior also. There are few examples of this type in the literature.  

Angelini et al.13 reported one patient who started at 4 years with atypical absences, followed six months later by tonic seizures. The EEGs showed long discharges of diffuse slow SWs without asymmetry, without focal predominance. No sleep recording was available. The CT scan was normal. Nocturnal tonic seizures increased in spite of various treatments and her behavior became abnormal. One year after the onset she presented with slight neurological impairments in the right side and EEG abnormalities clearly predominant from the left parietal region. One isotope brain scan and one left carotid angiography displayed the presence of a tumor in the parieto-temporal region, which was surgically removed. It was a type II astrocytoma. The child had no further seizures and SW disappeared in the EEGs. Two years later she was still seizure free.  

More recently, Quarato et al.14 published the case of one patient with an atypical, LGS suffering from atonic and tonic seizures, who was seizure free one year after the removal of a left parietal dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour. In that case, EEG and clinical signs pointed to left hemisphere origin of the seizures.  

We also have the case of S.G., who did not have family antecedent or a personal pathological history. At 10 years, he had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, followed by atypical absences and tonic seizures. Sometimes his tonic seizures were preceded by a conscious onset with head and eye deviation to the right. He continued to go to school but he has increasingly poor results. At 16 years 6 months, despite antiepileptic drugs, seizures increased, becoming diurnal and nocturnal. He was referred to our center at this time. Clinical examination was normal in this right-handed boy, but his verbal expression and his ideation were slow. EEGs showed diffuse slow SWs, in bursts facilitated by hyperpnea (Figure 44.5), and numerous discharges of diffuse subclinical rapid rhythms predominant in the anterior areas (Figure 44.6). The CT scan displayed a left frontal tumor, which was surgically removed without complication and seizures disappeared. The boy’s IQ was 94, with a slight frontal deficit. EEGs showed spikes localized in the left frontal region, without diffuse discharges, while awake and during sleep (Figure 44.7). Treatment was progressively reduced and stopped at 25 years. He now has a normal professional career. In this patient the LGS was related to a benign frontal tumor (low grade astrocytoma) and was cured by the lesionectomy, but this situation remains exceptional.

Other authors reported on patients with symptomatic LGS due to perinatal anoxo-ischemia resulting in porencephalic cyst who were successfully treated by surgery. However these patients were not separated from those with West syndrome and the diagnostic criteria for LGS were not well defined.15,16 One paper by Ishikawa et al.17 also reported one patient remarkably improved by this treatment.  

#### Cryptogenic cases: lesions not surgically removable  

In the second situation, by far the most usual, there is no lesion to be easily removed. Either one faces a cryptogenic case or lesions are extensive, diffuse, bilateral or not well defined: atrophy, ventricular dilation, cortical dysplasias, and other malformations. In these patients it is possible to discuss the indication of a palliative surgery, such as corpus callosotomy (CC) and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS).  

#### Corpus callosotomy (CC)  

First proposed by Luessenhop,18 this procedure has the objective of preventing the interhemispheric propagation of the discharges presumably responsible for the falls and the generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Preoperative evaluation is of great importance to delineate the shape and integrity of the corpus callosum and to decide what will be the extent of the section.19 In order to maintain sufficient connections for a good coordination of cognitive functions a certain amount of callosal fibers must be preserved. After several years’ experience it has been determined that the anterior two-thirds callosotomy is the best procedure because the conservation of the splenium avoids the disconnection syndrome; subsequent completion of the section remains an option in patients who fail to obtain an adequate response.20 However, recently Maehara and Shimizu21,22 advocated for an initial complete callosotomy, arguing that in young children it gives the best results for seizure frequency as well as for psychomotor development. CC has been applied to children and adults presenting with different types of severe, pharmacoresistant, epilepsies, without possibility of resective surgery. They were focal or generalized epilepsies, with multiple seizure types, mainly drop attacks, and epileptic status, often associated with a mental deficit.  

Rougier et al.23,24 reviewed the literature in 1997. CC is principally effective in seizure types characterized by drop attacks, due either to a tonic axial phenomenon, or to an abrupt loss of tone. Sometimes they are completely suppressed. More often $70\mathrm{-}80\%$ of cases) their frequency is dramatically reduced, between 60 and $100\%$ . Drop attacks are observed in different varieties of syndromes and are usually associated with other seizure types which are less susceptible to be improved by the operation. The best results are obtained when drop attacks are caused by a unilateral brain lesion, or when they are part of a bilateral frontal lobe epilepsy. A good result is observed in $65\mathrm{-}75\%$ of those patients. The results are comparable in adults and in children and the functional tolerance is higher in children, who are the best candidates.  

It seems that this surgical procedure could be improved by using the gamma knife as reported by Pendl et al. in 1999,25 who applied this technique to three patients, two of which with a LGS.  

Results of CC for the Lennox–Gastaut syndrome In the large body of literature concerning CC in intractable epilepsies the seizure types are usually described but the cases of LGS are not always identified. For example, Maehara and Shimizu 21 have studied 52 patients who underwent CC for ‘intractable generalized seizures’ mainly represented by drop attacks, but we do not know the number of patients suffering from LGS and those from other epilepsy types. This study reported not only the seizure outcome, which was particularly good for drop attacks $80.8\%$ seizure-free patients), but also the change in the daily life of the patients and the degree of satisfaction of their parents which was also high $(57\%)$ for the children’s parents but not for the adults’ parents $(12\%)$ . In the series from Montreal 26 there were 73 cases of CC performed for a variety of cerebral seizures and clinical entities between 1981 and 1986. Fifty-six patients suffered from a secondary generalized epilepsy (SGE) and 14 were classified as LGS. The results were considered satisfactory. Nevertheless there was no case with complete cessation of all the seizure types. The tonic drop attacks emerged as the major indication for this procedure: they decreased between 75 and $100\%$ in 11/23 patients $(48\%)$ , with complete disappearance in seven, whereas generalized tonic-clonic seizures decreased $>75\%$ in $6/19$ patients $(31\%)$ with complete disappearance in one. The authors assumed they had, at times, spectacular results in the cryptogenic LGS, with no clinical or EEG evidence of focalization, which contrasts with the results obtained by other authors. They also mentioned improvement in awareness and alertness, not attributable to changes in antiepileptic medication. In one patient, a new seizure type occurred after surgery, consisting of nocturnal focal adversive and clonic seizures. These data are consistent with the data reported by Spencer et al.27,28 on the occurrence of more intense focal seizures after callosal section. In the same way Spencer et al.29 have analyzed the EEG ictal patterns before and after CC, showing that the bilateral synchronous pattern was replaced by a unilateral or a focal onset, and that seizures newly localized to a lobe could occur, mainly in the frontal, sometimes in the parietooccipital lobe. Quattrini et al.30 observed the same changes in the postoperative ictal discharges. They also observed that after certain time, generally some months, lateralized discharges tend to generalize again, confirming that CC is replaced in discharge diffusion by other structures (brainstem, diencephalon).  

Ritter et al.31 reported 27 patients with LGS who underwent CC (19 complete, eight partial anterior). The selection criterion was the presence of drop attacks or frequent secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Duration of follow up was 2–18 months (median 6 months). Overall, $70\%$ of the patients had marked improvement in seizure control: tonic seizures decreased in frequency ${>}80\%$ in 14 of 23 patients $(60\%)$ ; GTC in nine of 15 $(60\%)$ ; atonic in seven of eight $(87\%)$ , and seizures associated with dropping in 13 of 21 $(61\%)$ . Repeated episodes of status epilepticus ceased in three of four patients.  

Provinciali et al.32 reported on the neuropsychological changes after partial CC in 15 patients with SGE, of which five were LGS. They tested memory, attention, visuo-motor ability, posture, motor dexterity, language, praxis and gnosis, as well as social behavior, one month before surgery, then 15–20 and 90–100 days postoperatively, without modifying the medical treatment. The short-term neuropsychological cost of this procedure appears to be low and seems to depend mostly on surgical parameters and brain conditions before the operation.  

Nakatani et al.33 and Sakaki et al.34 reported respectively four and two patients operated upon in Japan with a satisfactory result with respect to the seizures for all, in spite of a disconnection syndrome in three patients, transient in one and lasting in two.  

Gates 35 reviewed three series of CC, including 17, one and five patients with LGS in the respective series. Among them 15 achieved a satisfactory outcome. Gates reported that the presence of bilateral independent foci with capacity for secondary generalization was an indicator of good outcome.  

Pinard et al.36 had operated on 34 patients with more than three seizures a day, among whom eight patients were diagnosed as having LGS. Patients were followed prospectively for at least 2 years after anterior CC (19 patients) and for 1 year after complete CC (15 patients). The eight patients with cryptogenic LGS improved after anterior CC.  

Septien et al.37 emphasized the good results obtained in children with psychiatric problems. They had performed partial anterior CC in two children with LGS and major psychiatric troubles: frontal syndrome with hyperkinesia, distractibility, aggressiveness, alexithymia, loss of planning abilities. They observed a progressive improvement of this frontal syndrome during the 2 postoperative months, with the possibility of learning new skills, without a change in IQ. Associative functions depending on the posterior third of the corpus callosum were preserved. They thought this improvement was related to the reduction of seizures.  

Claverie and Rougier38 studied the outcome in terms of quality of life in 20 patients submitted to CC for intractable epilepsy, including three cases of LGS. In two of these three they observed a substantial change; they became capable of independent living, and one attended a specialized school. In the whole series it appeared that the psychosocial benefits obtained in $40\%$ of the patients were linked not only to the seizure reduction but also to the precocity of the intervention.  

Matsuzaka et al.39 studied 22 consecutive patients who underwent an anterior CC for intractable epilepsy. Seventeen of these patients had SGE, of whom eight had LGS. A crosscorrelation analysis and measurements of amplitude differences were performed between bilateral homologous regions pre-and postoperatively. The surgical outcome was excellent in 14 $(63.6\%)$ , including a complete elimination of seizures in four; good in three $\left(13.6\%\right)$ ; and poor in five $\left(22.7\%\right)$ patients. After surgery, interictal generalized synchronous SW bursts in the SGE patients were disrupted and changed to unilateral SWs in 11 patients and to bilaterally independent SWs in six. The unilateral group had better surgical outcome than the bilateral independent group. Preoperatively the first group had significantly lower interhemispheric synchrony and fewer regional changes in the side leading in time and the side dominant for amplitude, suggesting unilaterally predominant epileptogenesis that triggered the secondary bilateral synchrony. These findings lead to the hypothesis that a considerable range of variation exists in the underlying condition of epileptogenesis in each hemisphere, even in SGE, affecting the postoperative EEG changes and surgical outcome. Preoperative quantitative EEG analyses enabled the authors to predict the underlying conditions of epileptogenesis and the surgical outcome. Unfortunately the authors were not precise in indicating to which group the patients with LGS belonged.  

Kwan et al.40 analyzed findings and acute changes in electrocorticograms (EcoG) obtained during CC, in order to identify any relationships with the postoperative outcome of seizure activity, in 48 patients with LGS, all followed postoperatively for more than 4 years. Of these patients, 31 $(64.6\%)$ had significant improvement in seizure control. EcoG displayed bisynchronous discharges in $79.2\%$ of the 48 patients, and they were blocked during CC in $69.7\%$ , who achieved the best postoperative outcomes. But the difference did not reach statistical significance. Therefore, the changes in preoperative EcoG are not predictive.  

The largest series was reported by Cukiert et al.41 who performed one-stage callosal section, leaving only the splenium intact, in 76 patients with Lennox–Gastaut $\mathrm{\Delta}n{=}28\mathrm{\Delta}$ and Lennox-like $(n{=}48)$ syndromes. However, the latter is not defined by the authors. All patients were severely mentally impaired. Mean follow-up time was 4.7 years. Worthwhile improvement $(>50\%)$ was noted in 69 patients, with $90\%$ or more seizure reduction in 52, $100\%$ in seven. As in other series, the drop attacks were the most responsive seizure type $(92\%)$ , followed by atypical absences $(82\%)$ , tonic-clonic $(57\%)$ , and tonic $(51\%)$ seizures. Postoperative EEGs were obtained in 56 patients. In 42 they showed complete disruption of secondary bilateral synchrony, in six only partial disruption, in eight no change. But a postoperative acute callosal disconnection syndrome appears in 72 patients (apathy, urinary incontinence, right hemineglect, low verbal input, one mutism) which lasted for 8–50 days. After this period, the attention abilities were substantially improved.  

Interestingly, in two patients who had LGS with reflex seizures these seizures were reduced by $60\%$ in one (startle epilepsy) and disappeared in the second (tap epilepsy), unfortunately with a relapse after one year in the latter.42  

In all series, postoperative complications and side-effects were rare. When it appears, the disconnection syndrome is transient. All the authors underline that in children CC is usually followed by an evident improvement in psychomotor development and behavior, though it is not measurable by usual assessment methods.35,37,38  

At the end of this brief and incomplete survey, it appears that a number of patients with LGS can really improve with a partial anterior CC. In any case it is not a curative but a palliative treatment which can control the most ominous seizures represented by the drop attacks, mainly tonic in nature in this syndrome. Few papers give data on long-term results (more than 5 years’ follow-up) but it is never mentioned that good results were transitory. Spencer et al.26 followed patients postoperatively from 2–7 years. They indicate that ‘the stability of generalized seizure control after CC continues over many years of follow up’. The problem is not knowing the factors which could allow predicting the result of this intervention. Most authors reported better outcome in patients with a lateralized lesion or lateralized EEG anomalies, but in one series43 some cryptogenic LGS without asymmetry have been improved. Nevertheless, it is important to conduct a good preoperative EEG analysis in order to detect the type of electrogenesis in each hemisphere. The presence of a mental deficit is not a contraindication. Neuropsychological consequences are usually rare after partial section. It is recommended to perform surgery before the age of 10, in order to preserve a good intellectual outcome and to restore a good quality of life.  

#### Vagus nerve stimulation  

In the numerous publications studying the effects of VNS on epilepsy, the patients with LGS were often included in series of patients with ‘refractory’ or ‘intractable’ seizures, or with a low IQ. Few details were provided by the authors. The effect of VNS was evaluated at different times after surgery and was variable, from $50\%$ and more seizure reduction in few patients44, 45 up to more than $90\%$ seizure reduction.46,47 Most of the authors also indicate some degree of improvement in behavior, such as alertness and social communication. The side-effects were never disabling, consisting of change in the voice, hoarseness, sometimes coughing, at the time of the stimulation, and usually persisted only for some weeks.  

From the year 2000, LGS patients have been reported as a group and the conclusions are also variable. Moreover, the criteria for diagnosing LGS often lack and these groups include also cases designated as Lennox-like syndromes.  

The best study of VNS in patients with LGS was published by Majoie et al.,48 who gave the results of this procedure in 16 patients, aged from 7–18 years, accurately analyzed in terms of seizure and epilepsy type, frequency of the different seizure types, cognitive functions, quality of life and cost-effectiveness. This prospective, longitudinal cohort study included 16 ‘Lennox-like’ patients, among whom 12 with LGS, three with myoclonic astatic epilepsy, and one with myoclonic absences, followed from 6–12 months. The overall results showed that $25\%$ of the patients had a reduction of seizures of $50\%$ or more, with a mean for the individual patient of approximately $20{-}30\%$ . No patient was completely seizure free. There were no significant differences between the various seizure types and for patients with drop attacks ${\mathrm{\Delta}n}=10\$ ) only one was seizure free and one had more than $50\%$ reduction. The effects were moderate on neuropsychological functioning, a slight improvement appearing in the group with the highest mental age and not correlated with the seizure frequency reduction. The effects on EEG were not studied, but the best results were obtained in the patients with the best EEG background activity. The side-effects were low and transitory. The costeffectiveness analysis showed a decrease of $2876.06\:\mathrm{\textin}$ in the postoperative period of 6 months ( $1\ \mathrm{{\textperthousand}}$ was approximately equivalent to $\mathrm{~1~}\S$ ). The same authors reported the results after a 2-year follow-up,49 which were substantially the same with persistence of the seizure reduction rate at the same level and no more improvement in the neuropsychological functioning. Frost et al.50 reported a multicentric retrospective study of 50 LGS patients, aged from 5 to 27 years (median $=13$ years), $42\%$ younger than 12. Data were gathered at 1, 3, and 6 months after implantation. They had multiple seizure types, $66\%$ presenting with drop attacks. At 3 months, data were available for 43 patients. Seizures had decreased by $>75\%$ in 15 $(35\%)$ , and by $=50\%$ in 24 $(56\%)$ , and they have increased by ${>}50\%$ in 3. After 6 months, data were available for 24 patients (due to the data collection cutoff point). Seizures had decreased by $>75\%$ in 9 $(38\%)$ and by $=50\%$ in 14 $(58\%)$ , and no increase was reported. No patient was seizure free. According to the authors, drop attacks and atypical absences seemed to equally respond, but it was difficult to affirm that, since there was no prolonged video recording. They also mentioned an improvement in quality of life, which requires further studies because the scales they applied were very simple. The side-effects were similar to those in previous studies, but  

hypersalivation and worsened behavior and hyperactivity were also noted in respectively 4 and 3 patients.  

Buoni et al 51 reported a series of 13 patients, 7 with LGS of whom 6 with atonic seizures. Three had a $50\%$ or more seizure frequency reduction, mainly for atonic seizures, which the authors considered one good responsive seizure type, in contrast with the results by Majoie et al.48 However, their sample is small and atonic seizures are not always responsible for falls (drop attacks).  

Data about the effectiveness of VNS in LGS as regards other epilepsy types are unclear. Some authors 46 found a high rate of seizure reduction (from more than $50\%$ up to more than $90\%$ ) and others seem to indicate that it is equivalent48 or lower. Labar, 52 in a survey of 269 patients with 1-year follow-up, concluded that VNS responsiveness was associated with older age, longer duration epilepsy and syndromes other than LGS.  

As for CC, up to now there are no outcome predictive factors allowing the selection of patients with a good chance of improvment by VNS. Janszky et al.53 conducted a study in 47 patients, with long-term ictal and interictal EEG recordings, with a 1-year follow-up. Only four patients had a symptomatic generalized epilepsy. They concluded that only two factors were predictive for a complete control of the seizures, the presence of a cortical dysplasia and the absence of bilateral interictal epileptiform discharges, the latter independently. These preliminary results would be rather discouraging for LGS patients.  

Another group54 also attempted to find prognostic electroclinical features and studied seizure patterns in 17 patients, mainly with focal epilepsies (16 with falls) and including four LGS patients. Only four patients had a significant seizure reduction, a better outcome occurring in those seizures with a temporal lobe onset, and the poorest outcome occurring in frontal and fronto-central seizures. In the LGS patients there were no significant improvement, except a diminution of retropulsive falls.  

## Conclusion  

In conclusion, one must underline that none of the published patients treated by VNS for a LGS has been completely seizure free, even if one seizure type could have disappeared in few of them (atonic seizures).51 For this reason, the choice between the two types of palliative surgery, CC and VNS, should be discussed case by case. It is known that a real improvement in quality of life is obtained only in patients who become seizure free and not in patients with a seizure frequency reduction ${<}90\%$ . That was demonstrated for temporal lobe epilepsy surgery55 and for pharmacological treatment.56 However, patients suffering from LGS are extremely handicapped and diminution of drop attacks from several per day to several per month should represent a real change in daily life and the mood of the patient and his family and caregivers. Thus, after failure of several antiepileptic drugs, if the patient is not eligible for a resective surgery, the two options should be discussed. One recent study57 has compared the response to CC and VNS in a series of 77 patients, only 13 presenting with a LGS, for a follow-up duration of 9 months. Their results for the whole group showed better outcome after CC: $79\%$ of patients had a $50\%$ decrease in seizure frequency as compared with only $40\%$ for those with a VNS ( $\dot{p}{<}0.001)$ , and $57\%$ of patients had a $80\%$ decrease as compared with only $20\%$ of those with VNS ( $_{p=0.007)}$ . They do not indicate how many patients became seizure free. However, the number of complications was obviously higher in the CC $(21\%)$ than in the VNS $(8\%)$ , as well as their severity. One patient died in the postoperative period.  

CC is probably more likely to give a complete control of the most disabling seizures but is not lacking in serious risk, whereas the VNS gives less favorable results but is a safer procedure.  

To be complete it is necessary to mention that deep brain stimulations have been tried in selected patients,58 apparently with some positive results against atypical absences and tonic seizures 56,57 but this procedure does not appear to be actually used.

## Introduction  

The very title of this chapter raises a number of questions on definitions and conventions. First is the term medically intractable. This has to do not only with observations documenting that a patient has failed to respond to past or current trials of medications, but also to the implied improbability of a future response to further drug trials. This issue is explored in several chapters in Section 2: Overview. Second is the definition of remediation. Complete freedom from seizures is unarguably what is hoped for, as supported by psychosocial and quality of life studies which showed that improvements in employment and self-reported quality of life is correlated with a seizure-free status. However, would a $90\%$ reduction in seizures not sometimes be worthwhile, converting a patient with 10 seizures a month to one with one seizure a month? There is indeed data to show that patients with less than 12 seizures a year report better quality of life as compared to those with more seizures. But what about a $50\%$ reduction in seizures? While this is considered far from ideal after resection surgery, a $50\%$ reduction in seizure frequency is the realistic expectation with vagus nerve stimulation. These questions on outcome are explored in Section 17: Surgical Outcome. Third is the surgery itself. There are resection procedures, large and small; disconnection procedures; the technique of multiple sub-pial resection; and vagus nerve and brain stimulation. If we include all the above techniques, and we accept that a $50\%$ seizure reduction rate is an acceptable threshold of remediation, then in fact there is no medically intractable epilepsy that is not a candidate for surgical treatment, save for those with terminal or degenerative disorders who are considered to have too short a life expectancy.  

We will briefly discuss the generalized epilepsies but this is not the place to repeat a textbook account of these seizures and syndromes. The rest of the chapter surveys those partial epilepsies that have demonstrated sub-optimal outcomes after resection surgery for which caution and extra deliberation may be advised, and those patients with partial epilepsies who were not offered epilepsy surgery. Reports of negative outcomes in the literature are subject to publication bias, so when reports are available we need to give them perhaps even greater attention.  

### Generalized epilepsies  

The idiopathic generalized epilepsies of childhood and adolescence (and sometimes adulthood) are usually responsive to medications and fully controlled in $80\%{-}90\%$ , provided that medications have been judiciously selected. Pseudointractability arises when treatment relies on drugs that do not cover the spectrum of generalized seizures, or drugs that can aggravate generalized seizures1 (most commonly carbamazepine and gabapentin), or because of treatment noncompliance. A small minority remains with persistent seizures despite the best treatment and compliance. It seems that those epilepsies emerging later such as juvenile absence epilepsy and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy may be more likely to face some difficulties in obtaining complete seizure control as compared with those that present earlier. There are sometimes features suggesting an overlap with symptomatic generalized epilepsy in some of these patients with difficult to control epilepsy, such as a history of some prior neurological event, or of borderline intellectual function. When pharmacological treatment has failed, such patients may be candidates for vagus nerve stimulator implantation,2 although its use is still off-label.  

The secondary (symptomatic or cryptogenic) generalized epilepsies represent the opposite spectrum from idiopathic generalized epilepsy. Some also call these encephalopathic generalized epilepsies. Seizures often persist throughout life and many patients have significant mental impairment and other handicaps. These patients can constitute a sizeable proportion of the patients with medically intractable epilepsy at an epilepsy center. One prototypical example is LennoxGastaut syndrome which starts in childhood, manifests severe epilepsy with multiple seizure types, and has associated mental retardation. The most typical seizure types are tonic, atonic (drop attacks), and atypical absence seizures, although myoclonic, generalized tonic-clonic and partial seizures also occur. The EEG shows runs of $2{-}3\operatorname{Hz}$ (slow) generalized spike wave complexes, bursts of generalized paroxysmal fast $(10\ \mathrm{Hz})$ activity, and multifocal sharp waves.3 Other patients in the category of secondary generalized epilepsy have other combinations of multiple seizure types and multifocal sharp waves. While cases can be attributed to a specific etiology such as perinatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, malformations of cortical development, or neurocutaneous syndrome, some remain of unclear etiology. Yet others have transitional or other assorted features, making it difficult to be more specific in delineating a disease or syndrome.  

Of note in a book on epilepsy surgery, some patients with secondary generalized epilepsy can superficially look as though they may have partial seizures. Simple and complex partial seizures can indeed occur but are rarely the predominant seizure types in contrast to the different generalized seizures, and can be interpreted to be a manifestation of the multifocal nature of the disease. In ictal recordings this would be confirmed by a localizable ictal onset that is in logical agreement with the clinical signs. However, in other cases, what looks like a complex partial seizure with psychomotor automatisms on the ictal EEG first shows a generalized ictal onset pattern followed by a delayed localization of a rhythm over the temporal regions. So these may not be partial seizures in the proper sense, but a delayed recruitment of the temporal limbic system.  

First corpus callosotomy 4,5,6 and later vagus nerve stimulation7 had been used to treat patients with secondary generalized epilepsy, most commonly with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Tonic, atonic, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures seem to improve most after either of the procedures. There is less consensus to the degree to which myoclonic, atypical absence, or partial seizures improve after callosotomy. Both drop attacks and atypical absence seizures were reported to improve after vagus nerve stimulation.7  

### Partial epilepsies with reduced outcomes after resection  

For the sake of this discussion, we will adopt a definition of a reduced or sub-optimal seizure outcome when there is a less than $50\%$ chance of becoming seizure free or obtaining a substantial reduction in seizures after a cerebral resection procedure. The seizure-free group corresponds to Engel Class I, while substantial reduction would correspond to Class II, and also Class III if an earlier UCLA criterion of ${>}90\%$ reduction in seizures is used.8 Difficulties arise when a Class III ‘worthwhile’ outcome is not specified either in number of seizures or percentage reduction from baseline. The substantial reduction group would also include the Duke ‘Significantly Improved’ outcome of $<10$ seizures a year,9 and the category of $\mathrm{<}4$ seizures per year in the 1993 proposed scoring system.10  

Identification of the conditions that lead to a less than $50\%$ chance of seizure-free or substantial seizure reduction outcome is not presented here as an exclusion for (resection) surgery. The final decision for or against surgery will rest on a full discussion of the patient’s goals, expectations for success, and tolerance of adverse outcomes. Nevertheless it brings a perspective, and helps to separate the settings for success from those less likely, which can be useful when counseling patients considering surgery. This is admittedly a higher bar than that set for vagus nerve stimulation or drug trials, where a $40\%$ to $50\%$ chance of a $50\%$ or greater reduction in seizure frequency is the expected measure of success and with only a few patients becoming seizure free. But as with many human decisions, we adjust the bar set for a goal based on its associated risks. Craniotomy and excision of brain tissue inherently carry more risks. The $50\%$ seizure-free or significant reduction cut-off is probably also less meaningful when dealing with the sometimes ‘catastrophic’ or ‘malignant’ partial epilepsies seen in infancy or childhood, where daily seizures lead to developmental standstill, making palliation without complete control a desirable objective.  

#### Bitemporal epilepsy  

Repeated studies from some of the earliest on the surgery of temporal lobe epilepsy noted a reduced outcome for seizure control in patients with bitemporal spikes.9,11 Bitemporal interictal spikes are only one of several and a non-specific measure of bitemporal disease. Bitemporal epilepsy is now rightly defined by independent seizures recorded from each temporal lobe.12  

Bitemporal epilepsy does not by itself stand out as a distinct syndrome. Most importantly, one should separate bitemporal epilepsy with bilateral temporal lobe disease from falsely localizing interictal and ictal EEG findings in patients with extatemporal lesions. Patients with bitemporal epilepsy do show some differences from unilateral mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. First a history of febrile seizures is less than that in patients with unilateral temporal epilepsy,13 while a history of encephalitis and other diffuse cerebral insults is increased. Nearly all will have bilateral independent EEG spikes with or without slow waves over the temporal regions if recorded for long enough. Extracranial EEG ictal recordings are more likely to show not only independent seizure onsets, but also bitemporal non-localizable onsets, asynchronous ictal rhythms of different frequency and morphology over the temporal lobes proceeding simultaneously, and ictal patterns that switch in amplitude predominance from one temporal region to the other.14 They are more likely to show bilateral dysfunction in a range of measures: whether MRI, MRS, memory testing. As a group, their cognitive and memory scores are more impaired than for patients with unilateral disease, and may exhibit more personality problems.  

The issue to be discussed here is not that patients with demonstrated bitemporal seizures are not surgical candidates. In a review of several published series, $54\%$ obtained a good outcome (Engel Class I and II), somewhat less than that for patients with unilateral disease.12 What is interesting here is to look at the reasons for a bad result. The rate of seizure control is much less in series which offered most patients with bitemporal epilepsy surgery,15–17 as compared to those that exercised additional selection.18,19 Additional selection had been based on independent measures of mesial temporal disease: MRI findings of hippocampal atrophy and sclerosis, PET hypometabolism, and lateralized neuropsychological dysfunction that included the findings of the intracarotid amobarbital test. When there is some degree of concordance between seizure predominance as recorded by intracranial EEG and these independent tests, seizure outcome is improved. When there is no clear predominance of seizures from one side, the absence of congruent lateralization or the presence of discordant lateralization from independent tests, herald a poor outcome. It is this latter group who should be counseled on the low yield of surgery.  

#### Multifocal epilepsy  

Epilepsy with multifocal seizure onsets from non-contiguous areas, whether from the same hemisphere, or from both hemispheres is generally held to be not treatable by resection surgery. However, as we shall see later, there may be exceptions. Originally, this prohibition against operation on more than one area was probably influenced by the disastrous outcome to memory functions after bilateral surgical removal of the temporal lobes, leading to a permanent amnesic syndrome.20 Undoubtedly, the same prohibition applies to bilateral removal of the frontal lobes.  

The causes of multifocal epilepsy are sometimes evident and visible, a consequence of a multifocal disease such as encephalitis or tuberous sclerosis. At other times the potential for multifocal epileptogenicity is understood even though not necessarily anticipated, such as when MRI imaging shows only one area of cerebral malformation, or a single scar from head injury, but investigations reveal multifocal seizure onsets. Yet other cases remain difficult to understand.  

The term ‘multilobar’ resection was used by Rasmussen,2 but he included in this category the failure of piecemeal resections to improve seizures in Rasmussen’s encephalitis, and some cases of infantile hemiplegia with widespread epileptiform abnormalities throughout the hemisphere. The same would apply to surgery for hemimegalencephaly. These are all widespread or progressive disease states. We know that epilepsy surgery can be successful in these conditions, but calls for a more radical removal or disconnection of the diseased hemisphere. Rasmussen also presented the results of ‘frontal plus’ surgery at Montreal Neurological Institute.22 This very brief report did not detail the diseases or pathologies treated. What is notable is that of 63 patients who had removals from the frontal lobe and adjacent central or temporal regions, only $10\%$ became seizure free and another $24\%$ had ‘marked reduction’ of seizures. Then there were 13 patients who had reoperations on both the frontal and temporal lobes after a failed first operation. None of these patients became seizure free.23  

The results from Montreal contrast with results collected at the 2nd Palm Desert Conference in 1992. Between 1986 and 1990, 166 multilobar resections were performed worldwide, and $89\%$ were seizure free or had worthwhile $(>90\%)$ seizure reduction.24 The pathological conditions treated by multilobar resections are not known. More intriguing is a recent report of the success of staged multifocal resections in children with tuberous sclerosis.25 It raises the question that the success or failure of multifocal resections need to be reevaluated based on the underlying disease process. In patients with non-progressive multifocal epileptogenic lesions, surgery may work provided it does not violate patient safety and lead to unacceptable deficits.  

#### Dual pathology  

Dual pathology refers the presence of hippocampal sclerosis with another identifiable lesion in temporal or extratemporal locations. It may be considered another facet of multifocal epilepsy. Dual pathology so defined is found in about $15\%$ of patients with partial epilepsy.26,27 It seems more common in congenital disorders or when there is a history of an early insult. The pathological entities most commonly found associated with hippocampal sclerosis include: malformations of cortical development, porencephalic cysts, and atrophic gliotic lesions from old infarcts or contusions. Less common associations are indolent tumors and vascular malformations.  

Several studies reported on the surgical outcomes in patients with dual pathologies. The numbers of patients were by the nature of this condition small. Where only one of either the lesion or the mesial temporal structures was removed surgically, the chance of a seizure-free outcome was reduced to $10\%{-}17\%$ , although some had significant improvement.28–30 While there was a paucity of studies to no studies proving independent ictal onsets from the separate pathologies, this had been implicit in the observations. Selected patients who failed first surgery, became seizure free when a second surgery was performed to remove the remaining pathology. This suggests that when there is dual pathology, the surgical strategy should plan for removal of both pathological substrates, although the surgical steps can be staged.  

### Partial epilepsies with normal MRI findings  

Seizure outcomes after surgery are generally reduced in patients with temporal and extratemporal epilepsies and normal MRI.31,32,33,34 Several studies showed that additional preoperative non-invasive findings are extremely important to help predict a good or a poor outcome. The presence of localized interictal discharges on scalp EEG, and localized hypometabolism by PET were statistically significant predictors, while ictal scalp EEG afforded a trend but was not statistically significant in patients with neocortical epilepsy and normal MRI imaging.35 The presence of generalized interictal discharges in scalp was a bad omen in frontal lobe epilepsy, even if there were MRI abnormalities, as only one of ten $(10\%)$ patients became seizure free.36 In MRI negative temporal lobe epilepsy, the presence of bilateral independent or multifocal interictal discharges in scalp EEG also predicted bad outcome, with only four of 14 $(29\%)$ seizure free.32 There is additive value to the number of concordant non-invasive tests in prediction of outcome: when two or more tests are concordant, outcome is significantly better with $60\%$ becoming seizure free. This contrasts with a $30\%$ seizure-free rate in patients without any localizing findings on non-invasive testing.35  

Thus patients with neocortical epilepsy and normal imaging should be counseled on the reduced likelihood of a good surgical outcome if there are no localizing findings on non-invasive testing by scalp EEG and FDG-PET scan.  

#### Certain malformations of cortical development  

In contrast to relatively the good outcomes after resection of focal cortical dysplasia, some other developmental pathologies have not responded well to surgical treatment, whether by localized resection or by multiple subpial resection, despite intracranial EEG investigations. Of eight women with subcortical band heterotopia (double cortex syndrome) who underwent surgery, only one had significant improvement.37 Periventricular heterotopias also did not demonstrate a good surgical outcome particularly if there is bilateral disease. In a series of ten patients operated at Montreal (seven bilateral disease), only one had a significant reduction in seizures at longterm follow-up.38 This patient had unilateral heterotopia, and most of the abnormality was included in the temporal resection. Admittedly the resections were corticectomies that often did not include the heterotopic tissue, now known to be intrinsically epileptogenic, and part of the ictal epileptogenic zone together with overlying cortex. In a more recent surgical series in which resection targeted both the heterotopic nodules and associated cortex, excellent results were obtained in patients with unilateral heterotopias, but not in those with bilateral heterotopia.39  

Other subtle indices of malformation in cortical development may also be important in surgical outcomes. In a study using segmentation analysis of gray and white matter volume distributions,40 even a subtle abnormality outside of the temporal lobe is correlated with a reduced outcome after temporal lobectomy, with only four of 14 patients $(28\%)$ becoming seizure free, as against 11 of 13 patients $(85\%)$ without such extratemporal abnormalities.  

### Reasons patients are not selected for surgery  

#### Inability to localize the epileptogenic zone  

A proportion of patients are rejected from surgery in any surgical series after extensive investigations, either because the epileptogenic zone could not be localized, or because testing showed multifocal abnormalities. Non-localized, non-invasive testing is typically followed by intracranial EEG investigation in patients with suspected partial epilepsy, thus the published results of intracranial EEG investigations can give us some idea of how often patients are rejected from surgery for these reasons. Non-localizing intracranial EEG studies could be a result of inability to record seizures, mistaken investigation of generalized epilepsy, failure to target the epileptogenic zone from an incorrect hypothesis of its location, inadequate electrode coverage, true multifocal epileptogenicity, and perhaps abnormal networks that cause such rapid and widespread synchronization that confident interpretation of the site of seizure onset is not possible based on current understanding and technology.  

In a review by Spencer in 1981, she found that $18\%$ of patients investigated by depth electrodes were excluded from surgery.41 The rates were even higher in two European centers with a notable history of depth electroencephalography in that era, $23\%$ in Milan, and $35\%$ in Paris. For subdural EEG recordings, rather similar results were found. In a series of 50 patients from Oregon, 12 $(24\%)$ were excluded from surgery because of multifocal onset, inability to determine an onset, or bitemporal independent seizures.42 It can be argued that the rates for unsuccessful intracranial EEG would be expected to be higher in those earlier series that did not have the advantage of MRI and other imaging techniques now in use. A more recent report on the cumulative experience of 217 patients at Montreal Neurological Institute investigated by depth electrodes found that 37 $\left(16.5\%\right)$ were excluded from surgery afterwards, and that a further nine patients $(4\%)$ had technically unsatisfactory recordings.43 The proportion of patients with a localized epileptogenic zone falls when the preoperative MRI is negative. Only $58\%$ of a series of $43~\mathrm{MRI}$ negative patients proceeded to resection surgery after intracranial EEG investigation between 1992 and 1999, using combinations of subdural and depth electrodes.44 Thus $15\%-40\%$ of patients with complex findings that did not permit localization of the epileptogenic zone by non-invasive data and who underwent intracranial EEG investigation failed to obtain sufficient localization to recommend surgery, with the higher number when the MRI was normal.  

Epileptogenic zone located in eloquent cortex The number of patients who are not candidates for resective surgery because of this reason is probably smaller. There are several qualifiers that make the location of the epileptogenic zone in eloquent cortex more a relative contraindication than an absolute contraindication in many cases. First there is the risk benefit analysis undertaken by the patient and healthcare team as to whether the potential benefit of surgery outweighs the likely postoperative deficits. This is a highly individual decision. It seems there is some degree of rank ordering with some deficits considered more acceptable than others. Thus the deficits that follow resection of the primary sensory area in the postcentral gyrus, and of the visual areas in the occipital cortex are presumably acceptable to many as a trade-off for seizure control, if only because there are surgical series of such treatments. Experience also indicates that resection of the primary motor area of the face can be tolerated with only relatively minor problems.45 This leaves resection of primary motor areas of the arm and leg, and the language areas, as the least acceptable. To that is added permanent anterograde memory loss that can result from resection of the mesial temporal structures on one side if the other side is also diseased. This has fortunately become very uncommon with present presurgical protocols to evaluate both the structure and the function of the temporal lobes. Indeed there is now more controversy on the validity of memory assessments by the different test methods, particularly the intracarotid amobarbital (Wada) test. What is acceptable or not can be modified by a second consideration, namely the permanence versus the potential of recovery of the neurological deficit. When a deficit is transient, it is not at all a contraindication. Thus resection of the supplementary motor area can lead to an akinetic mute state with contralateral hemiplegia that can last several weeks before recovery.46,47 Although some minor deficits can persist, patients appropriately counseled and prepared for this possible outcome seemed to have come out at the other end with minimal discouragement. Reversibility is influenced by a third factor, namely the timing of the surgical procedure in the neurodevelopmental course of the individual. The earlier the resection, the greater the chance that even essential functions can be re-established. To illustrate, all three considerations are important when evaluating a patient for hemispherectomy or one of its ‘disconnection’ variants. Because the epileptic conditions (e.g., hemimegalencephaly, Rasmussen’s encephalitis, Sturge-Weber syndrome) that call for hemispherectomy are usually progressive or cause a ‘catastrophic’ decline in function, the first consideration of benefit versus risk is usually in favor of surgery. The second consideration of functional recovery is supported by empiric experience that children can regain locomotor use of the hemiplegic side, and maintain language functions. The third consideration on the timing of surgery is also important in that there is some consensus that the chances for speech development after resection of the dominant hemisphere is more likely to be assured if operation is carried out by the sixth year of age, and less likely if carried out after the age of ten. It should be emphasized that the course of speech recovery after left dominant hemispherectomy can take 6 to 12 months or more.4  

Adults with epileptogenic zones in eloquent areas not deemed candidates for resective can nevertheless be considered for other surgical procedures. The technique of multiple sub-pial transaction was developed for this very reason (see Chapter 126). New neurological deficits can still take place, reported in $22\%$ by one meta-analysis.49 Vagus nerve stimulation can be considered for palliation. There are ongoing investigational protocols for brain stimulation, either targeting subcortical structures with a view towards interruption of seizure networks, or direct brain stimulation of the epileptogenic zone by implanted intracranial electrodes, delivering an ‘abortive’ electrical stimulus to terminate the seizure discharge. Abortive direct brain stimulation takes advantage of advances in microelectronics and computer systems to make a responsive ‘closed-loop’ system that detects a seizure discharge and delivers the therapeutic output.  

#### No resection because of other surgical risks  

Resective surgery may not be offered for other surgical risks. It could be because the patient has too many other serious medical or psychiatric comorbidities that would jeopardize surgical or social recovery. But more often it is because the location of a large lesion that not only impinges on eloquent cortical areas, but also on subcortical motor tracts or major blood vessels, renders its complete removal prohibitive in terms of risk of a major neurological deficit in an otherwise intact individual.  

## Summary  

The decision for epilepsy surgery should always be a personal one informed by discussions between the patient and her doctors. Ultimately what constitutes a desirable result with regards to seizure control, and what constitute acceptable and unacceptable risks, have to be decided by the patient. There are however instances when the epileptic condition is inoperable, either because the risk of a major complication is considered too great, or because the seizure focus cannot be localized. Then there are situations in which a patient may not get operated on because the chance of a successful outcome is reduced below the expected threshold. It is of course the hope of all that further technological advances and scientific understanding will improve our ability to offer surgery to those who can benefit, increase the postoperative outcome, and at the same time identify others who may be best served by non-surgical therapies.

## Introduction  

The selection of infants with surgically remediable epilepsy poses unique challenges due to several age related special characteristics.1,2 The special characteristics span clinical presentation, seizure semiology, difficulties in examination, maturational aspects to the interpretation of scalp-EEG findings, anatomical and functional neuroimaging findings, pathological substrates, and decision making for goals, timing and type of surgery. Involvement of parents and guardians, and their level of understanding and informed consent for surgery add another dimension to the challenges. As in adults, the ultimate goal for surgical strategy in children is the identification of a focal, resectable epileptogenic zone. Surgical experience and postsurgical seizure outcome data in infants and young children from several centers around the world show encouraging seizure outcomes with low morbidity and mortality, and consensus is building on early evaluation for surgical management.2–7 In this chapter, we focus our discussion on these special age-related differences that are important to recognize in the management of children who are likely to benefit from the surgical treatment of epilepsy. Table 46.1 compares common findings during diagnostic evaluation of pediatric and adult patients for epilepsy surgery.  

### Presurgical investigations in infants and young children  

The presurgical investigations that are obligatory in all pediatric patients include a history and physical examination, long-term video-EEG monitoring, neuropsychological testing, and a high-resolution brain MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). Functional neuroimaging like brain FDG-PET (18fluro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography) is often helpful as an adjunct tool, especially in patients with subtle or doubtful brain MRI findings. Other investigations such as ictal SPECT (single photon emission computerized tomography), MEG (magnetoencephalography), fMRI (functional MRI) and invasive intracranial monitoring remain challenging in this population, but may be considered in selected infants and young children. Dilated eye examination by an expert ophthalmologist, and other organ system investigations (for example, in infants with tuberous sclerosis) in consultation with other specialists such as geneticist and neurometabolic experts should be considered in appropriate circumstances prior to surgery.  

#### Special characteristics in clinical presentation in infants  

Surgically remediable epilepsy in infants often presents as catastrophic epilepsy with associated developmental regression or arrest. Medical treatment options are usually exhausted within few weeks to months of seizure onset due to rapid trials in the face of daily intractable seizures. History usually offers important clues to the etiology of epilepsy. Age of seizure onset, the course of neurological symptoms, presence of symptoms indicative of multiple organ system involvement, family history, and history of premature birth, hypoxic event, significant head trauma or central nervous system infection may offer clues to possible etiology, type of central nervous system pathology, and a possibility of bilateral or global injury. The presence of neurocutaneous markers, congenital anomalies involving multiple organ systems, stigmata of metabolic diseases, micro- or macrocephaly, and abnormal neurological findings may suggest a specific genetic diagnosis or a particular group of conditions.  

Neurological examination is often challenging to elicit neurological deficits in this population. Neurological examination is helpful in presurgical evaluation if it shows unilateral hemispheric dysfunction with decreased use of one arm or side (hemiparesis), or gaze preference (homonymous hemianopsia). Recognition of subtle neurological abnormalities in infants requires experience and close observation during various activities. Mild hemiparesis may only present as early hand preference, reduced spontaneous movements of one side, poor grasp and dexterity of one hand, or unilateral small size of the limbs in early onset and long standing hemiparesis.8,9 Subtle differences in the tone and deep tendon reflexes may also be difficult to confirm. This may be due to immaturity of the central motor systems and corticospinal tracts.  

#### Special characteristics in evaluation of seizure semiology on video EEG  

There are several differences between the semiology of partial seizures in children compared with adults. Seizure characteristics suggesting partial onset, such as specific auras in adult patients, are unidentifiable in infants.10 Clinical seizure onset may be difficult to pinpoint with accuracy, especially in developmentally delayed and hypotonic infants, and this may create a challenge during scalp Video EEG and ictal SPECT.11,12 Assessment of the ictal level of consciousness in infants is fraught with problems, and automatisms, when infrequently present, tend to be simple, bland, and predominantly oral. Furthermore, distinguishing oral automatisms from normal background behavioral activity in infants can be difficult.13,14 Clearly identifiable and reproducible characteristics of localized seizure onset, such as clonic jerking or tonic/dystonic posturing of one extremity or one side, is rare in infants.15 Partial seizures arising from temporal or temporo-parietooccipital regions usually manifest with a decrease or arrest in behavioral motor activity, bland stare, with indeterminate level of consciousness and minimal or no automatisms. Partial seizures arising from frontal or fronto-parietal regions tend to present with symmetric or asymmetric bilateral tonic stiffening, sometimes preceded by or associated with bilateral eyelid blinking.14,16 It is generally recognized that the classification of partial epileptic seizures of the International League Against Epilepsy 17 reflect experience in adult patients, and therefore, may not be as useful in children below the age of 3 years.

#### Special characteristics and maturational aspects of scalp EEG patterns  

It is now well known that seizures in focal cortical lesions in infants may have no clinical or EEG findings to suggest partial epilepsy. Seizures are usually stereotypic infantile spasms, and scalp-EEG shows interictal hypsarrhythmia, diffuse electrodecrement during infantile spasms, and absence of focal EEG seizure patterns.18–21 Yet, many studies have shown cessation or significant improvement in seizures after the resection of the focal cortical lesion seen on the brain MRI and PET.4,7,19,22 Overall $65\%$ of affected infants are free of seizures after surgery,21 and infantile spasms with hypsarrhythmia are not predictive of poor surgical outcome. However, careful review of scalp-EEG in infantile spasms is still helpful as it may offer clues to a localized pathology by predominance of interictal sharp-waves over one region, localized slowing or decreased background activity, or absent sleep spindles over the affected region or hemisphere. Sometimes careful history and review of earlier video-EEG evaluations may show intermixing of infantile spasms with partial seizures (EEG and clinical) during early infancy eventually to be replaced or overwhelmed by infantile spasms. Ictal scalp-EEG in infants may offer clues to focal pathology by unilateral electro-decremental events, generalized but asymmetric electroencephalographic EEG patterns, or occurrence of partial EEG seizure patterns before, during, or after a cluster of infantile spasms.2,23  

Generalized scalp-EEG patterns in the presence of focal lesion may not be limited to infants. More recently it has been recognized that scalp-EEG may show generalized and bilaterally multiregional interictal and ictal findings even in older children with an MRI lesion, and seizure freedom is possible after surgery47. Further, generalized discharges/slow spike and wave resolve postoperatively in such patients, and are likely to be a secondary phenomenon. Authors reported 10 children (age 3–16 years) with generalized and bilateral multiregional interictal and ictal EEG (without any solitary or predominant focal EEG) and a brain MRI lesion who were surgically treated. All had catastrophic epilepsy resistant to all possible medical treatment. Surgery was offered as a last resort after critical evaluation, parental consent and bioethics approval. MRI showed encephalomalacia in four, malformations in three, and remote stroke in three patients. On postoperative follow-up (mean 26 months), eight were seizure free, and two had rare seizures. All had remarkable improvement in quality of life. Postoperative EEG at 6 months showed resolution of generalized discharges/slow spike and wave in all patients. The authors concluded that generalized and multiregional epileptiform scalp-EEG findings (and without any single or predominantly focal EEG) may occur in older children in the presence of a brain insult early in life, and do not preclude benefit from surgery.  

It is, therefore, not uncommon to see generalized EEG patterns in pediatric patients with surgically remediable epilepsy. This recognition is important, and every effort should be made to look for subtle clues to focal pathology in the EEG, and previous EEGs should be reviewed whenever available.  

#### Special characteristics in anatomic and functional neuroimaging in infants  

Brain MRI is a key investigation in planning surgical strategy at all ages, but in infants it assumes even a higher level of importance due to common occurrence of generalized or nonlocalized EEG patterns as discussed in the previous section. With the availability of high-resolution brain MRI and three-dimensional volume acquisition sequences, the brain MRI can demonstrate the presence of subtle cortical dysplasias, developmental tumors like dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors, and other malformations of cortical development which are the most common pathological substrates in infants with surgically remediable epilepsy. The presence of subtle cortical dysplasia may only be evident as loss of gray-white matter junction, loss of normal white matter arborization, localized thickening of cortical ribbon, or abnormal morphology of gyri and sulci.24  

Infants present a unique challenge in interpretation of brain MRI abnormalities that may be subtle or focal, like focal cortical dysplasias. This is due to immaturity of myelination and normal lack of gray-white matter distinction during the first year of life. The brain MRI during infancy shows a maturational dependent change in the signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted images as the brain matures from caudal to cephalad and from dorsal to ventral surface.25,26 The importance of finding a lesion on brain MRI can be demonstrated by several studies that showed that the complete resection of the brain MRI lesion resulted in the seizure-free outcome in a significantly higher percentage of patients when compared to those with only partial resection of the lesion or resection in the absence of a MRI lesion.5  

Brain FDG-PET was shown to be an especially useful tool in identifying infants for epilepsy surgery, as it may show a region of abnormality that may be obscured on brain MRI due to its subtle nature and immaturity of the myelination process.4,27,28 However, this is seldom the case these days due to improvement in MRI technology and increased expertise in detecting subtle cortical abnormalities. Other confounding factors that must be considered while interpreting brain PET in infants and young children with frequent seizures include the difficulty in accomplishing a true interictal study due to occurrence of clinical or EEG seizures just before or during the PET scan, dynamic nature of brain maturational process, and evolution of certain pathological substrates of seizures over time as in tuberous sclerosis, Struge-Weber syndrome or Rasmussen’s encephalitis. Nonetheless, brain PET remains a valuable noninvasive supplementary tool in localization of the epileptogenic zone.  

Ictal SPECT is increasingly being used as a diagnostic procedure for localizing epileptic seizure focus, especially in patients with extratemporal epilepsy and a normal brain MRI.11 It has proven useful in some pediatric patients where the most common location of epileptogenic lesions is extratemporal. However, some special challenges exist in obtaining and interpreting the ictal SPECT studies in infants and young children with frequent seizures. These include difficulty in accomplishing a true interictal SPECT due to multiple daily seizures, difficulty in promptly recognizing the clinical onset of ictal behavioral changes due to age and coexistent mental retardation often resulting in a late injection, brief duration and rapid spread of spasms and other seizures of extratemporal origin, and two-time sedation that may be required for interictal and ictal study. The advent of techniques such as subtraction SPECT with co-registration on magnetic resonance imaging (SISCOM) and computer imageguided surgery has enhanced the clinical electrophysiologic evaluation of SPECT detected abnormalities in epilepsy. Recent studies have suggested that the probability of seizurefree outcome is significantly higher in patients with nonlesional extratemporal epilepsy when surgery involved the SISCOM focus than when it did not.29–31  

The role of other neuroimaging modalities like magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and functional MRI (fMRI) in young children with catastrophic epilepsy has not been systematically studied.  

### Special characteristics of pathological substrates in pediatric patients  

Pathological substrates of epilepsy are different in infants when compared with older children and adults. Hippocampal sclerosis, the most common etiologic factor in adult candidates for epilepsy surgery, is uncommon in infants. In pediatric epilepsy surgery series from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation,7 hippocampal sclerosis was the cause in only $12\%$ of 62 children (age 3 months to 12 years) and $15\%$ of 74 adolescents (age 13 to 20 years). Whenever hippocampal sclerosis was found as the etiology of epilepsy, Pediatric patients appeared to have an especially high incidence of dual pathology with cortical dysplasia.32  

In infants and young children, the predominant etiologies that lead to epilepsy are focal or multilobar malformation of cortical development (cortical dysplasia), and low-grade tumor. These were the cause of the epilepsy in $57\%$ of adolescents, $70\%$ of children, $90\%$ of infants younger than 3 years in the Cleveland Clinic series,7 and $90\%$ of infants treated surgically in the series of Duchowny and colleagues.5 Congenital hemispheric malformations of brain development such as hemimegalencephaly or extensive hemispheric malformations are also important etiologies in infants undergoing epilepsy surgery in the form of hemispherectomy.9 Perinatal unilateral cerebral ischemic (vascular) insults, Sturge-Weber syndrome, and Rasmussen’s chronic focal encephalitis are other etiologies where hemispherectomy may be indicated.6,9 Less common indications for epilepsy surgery are etiologies like encephalomalacia related to remote trauma or infection.  

The age-related differences in etiology result in an agerelated spectrum of surgical procedures. Anteromesial temporal resections predominate in adults33 but not in children. In pediatric series, extratemporal or multilobar resections or hemispherectomies composed $44\%$ of the surgeries in adolescents, $50\%$ in children, and $90\%$ in infants.5  

### Special surgical characteristics in pediatric patients  

### Timing of epilepsy surgery  

Recent pediatric series justify early epilepsy surgery in infants with catastrophic epilepsy, regardless of age.6 Improvement in surgical techniques, anesthesia, and pediatric intensive care during peri- and post-operative periods significantly reduced the mortality and frequency of complications. The risk of proceeding with surgery must be weighed against the risk of continuing with uncontrolled seizures treated medically. If careful analysis yields a favorable risk/benefit ratio for surgery, then surgery should be considered. The usual delay from onset of seizure intractability to surgery is still in the range of 12–15 years at most centers, reflecting a reluctance to consider surgery during childhood. Complicated infants in need of epilepsy surgery should be considered for referral to specialized centers with extensive pediatric experience.6  

### Goals of epilepsy surgery  

The goals of epilepsy surgery may vary according to age. In adolescents and adults, the main goals are usually related to driving, independence, and employment, and their achievement requires complete postoperative freedom from seizures.34 For infants and children, the goals often center on relief of catastrophic epilepsy, resumption of developmental progression, and improvement in affect and behavior. For infants and young children with catastrophic epilepsy and daily seizures, even a postoperative outcome with rare or infrequent seizures may be gratifying with improvement in developmental progression. Seizures that begin in the first few years of life, regardless of etiology, constitute a risk factor for mental retardation.8,35–37 Early surgical intervention may reduce this risk by allowing resumption of developmental progression during critical stages of brain maturation, but quantitative and prospectively collected data are scant.5,6  

### Postoperative new deficits and plasticity  

Risks for occurrence and chances of recovery from new postoperative neurological deficits (e.g., hemiparesis or language impairment), may be reduced in pediatric patients as a result of developmental plasticity and potential for transfer of eloquent functions. In patients with Rasmussen’s encephalitis involving the left (dominant) hemisphere, transfer of language has been described to the right hemisphere during the course of the illness.38 Language may also develop in unusual regions of the left hemisphere in a congenital malformations or tumors involving the left frontal or posterior temporal region.39,40 In these cases, the epileptogenic lesion may be resected or disconnected without worsening or producing new language deficits. Motor function may also partially develop outside a damaged or malformed rolandic region, so that resection of a perirolandic lesion results in little or no additional postoperative motor deficit. Factors favoring developmental plasticity include early onset of the lesion (e.g., perinatal infarction or congenital malformation) and surgery performed within the first few years of life.  

### Mortality in infants undergoing epilepsy surgery  

Epilepsy surgery in infants has higher morbidity and mortality compared to adults due to several factors such as perioperative blood loss and hypothermia in the face of lower weight and smaller blood volume, radical surgeries with multilobar or hemispheric resections, and higher likelihood of metabolic derangements. The risk of death in recent larger series from several centers is around ${\sim}1{-}1.5\%$ .7,22,41–43 However, the mortality from epilepsy surgery in infants still compares favorably against the mortality from uncontrolled seizures treated medically. In a populationbased cohort study in children44 (1–16 years of age) who developed epilepsy between 1977 and 1985, 26 $\left(3.8\%\right)$ of 692 children died by the year 1999. Majority (13 of 26) of the children who died had secondarily generalized seizures. Presence of neurological deficit was the only independent factor that determined mortality. Similar results have been reported from a Dutch study.45,46 These epidemiological data reinforce consideration for early surgical intervention as children with surgically remediable catastrophic epilepsy often have neurological deficits and secondarily generalized seizures.  

## Conclusions  

Presurgical evaluation in infants and young children entails a variety of special challenges, and requires a special set of skills for accurate interpretation of clinical data, EEG, and imaging studies. In addition, decision for surgery requires a careful study of the benefit/risk ratio in every child, keeping in mind the complicated interplay of age-related factors and parental understanding. All children with catastrophic epilepsy, regardless of age, must be promptly evaluated for the possibility of surgically remediable epilepsy. Management of infants with surgically remediable catastrophic epilepsy is best done at centers with experienced and dedicated team of pediatric epilepsy specialists, neurosurgeons, anesthesia, and intensive care staff.
